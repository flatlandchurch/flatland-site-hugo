## Encounter Night

Would you like to experience God’s peace? His joy? His love? Join us on Sunday, June 1, for our next Encounter Night at Flatland. This powerful encounter with God begins at 6:00pm. Childcare is available for children 5 and under.

## Family Dinner

Come early if you'd like and join us for a Flatland Family Dinner at 5:15pm. If your last name begins with N-Z, please bring a main dish this time. If your last name begins with A-M, please bring a side dish or dessert to share. Arrive between 5:00-5:15pm to get your dishes onto the buffet. Parents, please sit with your children for the meal as they eat. 

Let’s move!
