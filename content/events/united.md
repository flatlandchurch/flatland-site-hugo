## United Service

On Sunday, September 21, we will have one, united service at Flatland. We will not have our regularly scheduled 9:30am service. Instead, we will join together at 11:00am to hear from our pastors, Bart & Jen Wilkins.

## Church Picnic

Lunch is on us! Stay after service for a church picnic: fried chicken, chips and cookies. Bring <b>lawn chairs</b> to sit and eat outside. Kids will enjoy a <b>Foam Party</b>, so bring towels to dry off.

Letâ€™s move!
