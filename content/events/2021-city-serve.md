Flatland annually partners with, Within Reach and Omaha area churches to show our community the love of Jesus through kindness and service. This year we have three projects we will be doing Sunday afternoon, September 19. 

If you are unable to attend the actual serve day, you can help provide supplies needed. Use the registration link to let us know how you will partner with us. This is a great event for family and kids to be involved with together.
