Have you ever prayed and wondered if God was really listening? You’re not alone.<br>
This six-week journey explores scripture to find out how God teaches us to pray. We’ll learn why prayer can feel unproductive or frustrating, and discover how it can become a real, life-giving conversation with God. Whether you’re new to prayer or have prayed for years, you’ll find hope, joy, and fresh connection with the God who hears you.
