# Flatland Women's Event
## February 27-28, 2026
### Friday 5:00pm to Saturday 1:00pm
### Cost: $50 ($25 for ladies 25 and under)

Join us Friday evening as we unite with thousands of women worldwide for a night of worship and teaching from Jennie Allen, Francis Chan, Christine Caine, and many others.

Saturday morning Flatland women will share their stories and encourage one another to live faithfully for Jesus. We'll continue the conversation with table discussions.
