Plan a Visit
{{< /action >}}<br>

This United service at Flatland is one of our most creative and enjoyable services of the year. If you want to know what we will be talking about in our sermons in 2026, this is the service for you! Our teaching and creative teams have been hard at work praying and planning for 2026. Now it's time to unviel our eight sermon series for the the coming year. We do this in a highly creative fashion. This year's Review/Preview features our National Park Edition.

Here are some of the things you can expect to encounter: a wild animal photo booth, kids' activities, a trail mix bar, park rangers, audience participation, inspiration, laughter, friendship and more.
