Experience the story of anticipation fulfilled.
Join us as Luke Storer brings Simeon to life—the man who waited his whole life to see God’s promise come true. Through a powerful, live monologue, we’ll step into the moment Simeon held the Messiah in his arms and declared, “My eyes have seen your salvation.”

Come be reminded that hope is never wasted when it’s placed in God’s promises.
