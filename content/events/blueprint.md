Life doesn’t come with a blueprint, but God has one. When the future feels uncertain, when you’re not sure what God is doing, or when your own plans fall apart, it’s easy to wonder if He has a plan at all. We read prophetic books in the Bible and can feel even more confused. In this series, Blueprint, we’ll read through Zechariah and learn how to read prophetic books. Even more importantly, we’ll discover that God has been working on something beautiful all along. Find out how you fit into His plans.
