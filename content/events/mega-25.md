## MEGA Sports Camp

# July 14-18

# 9:00 am to 11:30am

MEGA Sports Camp is for kids ages 3 years (by 1/1/25) through fifth grade. This is a fun-filled time for beginners and pros alike! It doesn’t matter if they’ve played all their life or are just starting today.

Our theme for the week is “In Your Element.” Kids will be able to choose from four sports: soccer, cheerleading, track, and flag football! Each day will feature drills and practice focused on building strong fundamentals to help them grow as athletes. We’ll also participate in songs, stories, and object lessons designed to bring kids closer to God.

The cost is $25 per child, which includes a camp t-shirt and all materials needed for the week. Please note that registration after June 27 does not guarantee a t-shirt or the correct size.

Refund Policy: We are unable to offer refunds for registrations. Once students are registered we will obtain supplies, materials and product for your child's participation.

Invite your neighbors and friends. We can't wait to get started!
