Our top priority at Flatland is to help you move to the center of God’s kingdom. God designed your life to function at it’s best when you are closest to Him.

Whether you are exploring Christianity, growing in your faith, feel close to Christ, or have centered your life around Him, we believe that getting into a one-on-one discipleship relationship will help you move closer to God.

Our discipleship pathway provides opportunities for you to have life-transforming spiritual conversations with a mature follower of Christ. You will be equipped with materials that you can study, discuss and apply.

The following questionnaire will help us help you determine where to jump into our discipleship pathway at Flatland. By answering a few questions about your spiritual beliefs and practices, we can recommended your next step or even auto-enroll you into our pathway if you so choose.
