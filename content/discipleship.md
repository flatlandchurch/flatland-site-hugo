Our Discipleship Pathway at Flatland is designed to help you move to the center of God's kingdom. Are you exploring Christianity? This is a great way for you to ask questions. Are you growing in your faith? We can help you know God better. Are you struggling to trust God? We would love to hear your story and strengthen your faith. Do you want to grow closer or stay centered? We have a pathway for you.

## Our Pathway

Our Discipleship Pathway is divided into two parts: <b>Understanding Christianity</b> and <b>Practicing Christianity</b>. Before you embark on this journey, however, we recommend you check out <b>Flatland 101</b>. This will equip you with important tools and information for a successful journey toward the center of God's kingdom.

### Understanding Christianity

If you are new to Christianity, or don't feel you have learned a lot about God, the Bible, prayer and other spiritual teachings and practices, this section will greatly enhance your knowledge of what it means to follow Jesus into a thriving relationship with God. If you have quite a bit of understanding about Christianity, we believe this section will strengthen your faith and further expand your understanding of God and His word.

## Our Process

### Whatâ€™s involved?

Discipleship really requires community. The majority of our units are offered as classes or small cohorts that meet weekly or every other week. A few units are compact workshops that can be completed in a day or two. The lists of units above is our recommended order for the pathway; however, detours are common and okay. Taking them out of order on occassion will not prevent you from moving to the center of God's kingdom.
