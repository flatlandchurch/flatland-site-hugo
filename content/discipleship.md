Our Discipleship Pathway at Flatland is designed to help you move to the center of God's kingdom. Are you exploring Christianity? This is a great way for you to ask questions. Are you growing in your faith? We can help you know God better. Are you struggling to trust God? We would love to hear your story and strengthen your faith. Do you want to grow closer or stay centered? We have a pathway for you.

## Our Pathway

Our Discipleship Pathway is divided into two parts: <b>Understanding Christianity</b> and <b>Practicing Christianity</b>. Before you embark on this journey, however, we recommend you check out <b>Flatland 101</b>. This will equip you with important tools and information for a successful journey toward the center of God's kingdom.

### Understanding Christianity

If you are new to Christianity, or don't feel you have learned a lot about God, the Bible, prayer and other spiritual teachings and practices, this section will greatly enhance your knowledge of what it means to follow Jesus into a thriving relationship with God. If you have quite a bit of understanding about Christianity, we believe this section will strengthen your faith and further expand your understanding of God and His word.

## Our Process

### Whatâ€™s involved?

Discipleship really requires community. We will connect you with an individual or small cohort to help you process through a variety of books and resources. Together, you can freely discuss the material and any questions or thoughts you may have. At the completion of each book or resource, you'll have the opportunity to immediately move to the next one or take a break if needed.

### How often will we meet?

We recommend meeting weekly, but you can adjust to fit your schedule and availability. Your mentor or cohort leader will work with you to create a schedule that works for you. You'll also work with your mentor or cohort leader on meeting locations. People often meet at the church or at a coffee shop of their choice.
