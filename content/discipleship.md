Our Discipleship Pathway at Flatland is designed to help you move to the center of God's kingdom. Are you exploring Christianity? This is a great way for you to ask questions. Are you growing in your faith? We can help you know God better. Are you struggling to trust God? We would love to hear your story and strengthen your faith. Do you want to grow closer or stay centered? We have a pathway for you.

## Our Pathway

Discipleship really requires community. The majority of our units are offered as classes or small cohorts that meet weekly or every other week. A few units are compact workshops that can be completed in a day or two. The list of units below is our recommended order for the pathway; however, detours are common and okay. Taking them out of order on occassion will not prevent you from moving to the center of God's kingdom. Before you embark on this journey, however, we recommend you check out <b>Flatland 101</b>. This will equip you with important tools and information for a successful journey toward the center of God's kingdom.
