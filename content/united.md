## Sunday, September 22, 11:00 AM

On Sunday, September 22, we will only have one service at 11:00am. This service will feature a unique Q & A with our lead pastor, Bart Wilkins, and his wife, Jennifer. They founded Flatland in 1996. This is your opportunity to ask Bart & Jen anything. Use our anonymous form to ask questions about their marriage and ministry, the church, God and the Bible, food, hobbies, travel, or any other topic of interest to you. You can ask up to three questions. These will be compiled with other questions and presented to Bart & Jen before Sunday, September 22. Please submit your questions by Wednesday, September 18.

### All-Church Picnic

After the service, enjoy our all-church picnic full of food, fun and fellowship. We'll have fried chicken and more. Bring a lawnchair and a friend.
