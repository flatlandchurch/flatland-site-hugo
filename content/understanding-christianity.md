Our Discipleship Pathway at Flatland is designed to help you move to the center of God's kingdom. Are you exploring Christianity? This is a great way for you to ask questions. Are you growing in your faith? We can help you know God better. Are you struggling to trust God? We would love to hear your story and strengthen your faith. Do you want to grow closer or stay centered? We have a pathway for you.

## Understanding Christianity

If you are new to Christianity, or don't feel you have learned a lot about God, the Bible, prayer and other spiritual teachings and practices, this section will greatly enhance your knowledge of what it means to follow Jesus into a thriving relationship with God. If you have quite a bit of understanding about Christianity, we believe this section will strengthen your faith and further expand your understanding of God and His word.
