**September 20, 2020**

This past week, our entire staff became exposed to COVID-19. Several of our staff are getting tested, and we are planning to quarantine until we get the all-clear. As a result, we are canceling our in-person services at both campuses for September 20 and 27. If all goes well, we will resume in-person services at our Flatland 144 campus on October 4. We are planning to hold off resuming services at Flatland 174 until further notice.

Unfortunately, Kelvin & Nancy Nygren, our campus pastors at Flatland 174, have tested positive for COVID-19. They are experiencing very mild symptoms and were tested out of an abundance of caution. Please keep them in your prayers for a quick and full recovery.

In addition to canceling our morning services for the next two Sundays, we will also cancel next Wednesday's youth service, September 23. We are tentatively planning to resume youth group on Wednesday, September 30.

We will allow any Life Groups to meet that have not been in close proximity to our staff. Please contact your Life Group leader to determine if they will be meeting in-person and/or online.

2 Timothy 1:7 teaches us that "God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline." (NLT) We do not live in fear, but we do want to make sound decisions for the well-being of our congregation. We are also asking and believing God to offer healing and wholeness in Jesus' name to those affected.
