Because of the sin throughout the community, God gave instructions for sacrifices to be made. These sacrifices provided a ritual cleansing of the people and offered a way for them to renew their right fellowship with the LORD God. All of these sacrifices were done in anticipation of a renewed, or new, covenant. Jesus came as the final, perfect sacrifice who would take away the sins of the world, offering forgiveness and life to all who call on His name. It is by the blood of Christ that we are reconciled to God.

## Exodus 29:38-46

38 “This is what you are to offer on the altar regularly each day: two lambs a year old. 39 Offer one in the morning and the other at twilight. 40 With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering. 41 Sacrifice the other lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and its drink offering as in the morning—a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord.

42 “For the generations to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the Lord. There I will meet you and speak to you; 43 there also I will meet with the Israelites, and the place will be consecrated by my glory.

44 “So I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar and will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests. 45 Then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God. 46 They will know that I am the Lord their God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the Lord their God." (NIV)

## Hebrews 9:11-14

11 But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. 12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. 13 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. 14 How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! (NIV)

## Prayer

Heavenly Father, thank You for sending Jesus Christ as our atoning sacrifice. You love us while we are still sinners, and you provide a way for forgiveness and reconciliation. Forgive my sins as I put my faith in the sacrifice Jesus made for the world. Help me live a life worthy of His sacrifice. In Jesus' name, amen.
