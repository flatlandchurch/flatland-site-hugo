## More Questions?

### What do I wear?

Wear what makes you comfortable. Most folks come in jeans and button-down shirts. Even our pastors teach in jeans most weeks.

### What about my kids?

We have age-specific ministries on Sunday mornings for children from birth to 5th grade. Our kids environment is secure, and every single volunteer is background checked. We want your kids to learn more about Jesus and his Kingdom, in a safe, fun, and Biblical way. Learn more about FlatKids.
