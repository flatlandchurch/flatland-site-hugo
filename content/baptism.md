Baptism is a public declaration of an inward decision to follow Jesus.

When you are baptized in water, you are symbolically recreating the death and resurrection that Jesus went through for us.

We have baptisms on Sunday mornings about every six weeks. Sign up below to get baptized at our next baptism.
