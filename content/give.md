Giving is one of our greatest privileges as Christ-followers. It is an act of worship, the overflow of a grateful heart. Jesus said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” That’s where true joy is found—on the giving side of life. It starts with giving God the tithe, the first ten percent of our income. Giving above and beyond the tithe is called an offering, and it’s one way to grow in generosity.

> But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you—see that you also excel in this grace of giving. (2 Corinthians 8:7)

## Give Online

While you are more than welcome to give in person at any of in-person locations, we also offer simple and secure online giving through our giving partner, Planning Center. You can give a one-time gift or setup recurring donations.

You can also give via Text. Text any amount to **84321** to give. Standard message and data rates may apply. When you initiate your first Text-to-Give donation, our system will respond with a message that includes a setup link.

## Financial Resources

It can be difficult to practice generosity when you are living paycheck-to-paycheck, or worse, barely scraping by. We don't want anyone to experience bondage to debt, which is why we offer Financial Peace University, a 9-week class designed to give you the tools and education to get debt free, develop an emergency fund, and start to save up for the future. We offer FPU at various times throughout the year.

## The Move

It is so exciting to be a part of God's mission for the world. He loves people and longs to see them enter His Kingdom through faith in Jesus Christ. His church is the primary vehicle to take this good news to the world. With that in mind, I invite you to partner with me to advance His kingdom.

The Move is our way of giving to ministry organizations, projects and efforts that influence lives for the kingdom. The most effective initiatives are the sending and supporting of missionaries, the development of new Christian leaders, and the expansion of the local church. The best investment you can make in the kingdom of God is in these three areas.

That is why I invite you to join me in giving to The Move. This booklet outlines the many ways we are working to build the church and make disciples in 2021. Your monthly or one-time giving to this endeavor will change lives and help us fulfill the mission God has given His church. Together we can advance the kingdom and make disciples of all nations for the sake of Christ and the glory of God.

Let's move!
