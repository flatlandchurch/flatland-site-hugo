## Core Beliefs

### One God in Three Persons

We believe in One God in Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

### Salvation in Jesus

We believe that Jesus came to rescue the world through His life, death and resurrection, and that salvation comes through faith in Him.

### Life in the Holy Spirit

We believe that the Holy Spirit lives in those who follow Jesus, bearing fruit in our lives and empowering us with gifts to serve.

### The Bible

We believe that the Scriptures are God's word to us, revealing His wisdom for life and salvation in Jesus Christ.

### Gifts of the Spirit

We believe that the gifts of the Spirit are available today and are to be used to build others up.

### The Gift of Tongues

We believe that this gift of the Holy Spirit--unique to the New Testament--is available for every believer.

### The Second Coming

We believe in the resurrection of the body and the second coming of Christ to judge the living and the dead before making all things new.<br><br>
