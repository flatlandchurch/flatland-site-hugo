## A Daily Spiritual Practice

Take at least 10 minutes to abide in God's presence, asking Him to review your past and coming day with you and instruct you in His ways.

### 1.	Become Still Before God (approximately 1 minute)

- Take deep breaths, acknowledging the presence of the Holy Spirit.

- Invite Him to fill you with His grace, mercy, wisdom and love.

### 2.	Review Your Day (approximately 3 minutes)

- Consider the blessings you received or experienced these past 24 hours.

- Take a moment to thank God.

- Ask the Holy Spirit to help you recall the following questions. 

> What interactions did you have?

> What moments did you have by yourself?

> What opportunities to reflect God’s goodness and love did you take?

> How did you miss the mark?

### 3.	Pay Attention to Your Heart (approximately 2 minutes)

- Ask Him to help you recall and reflect on the following questions. 

> Was my heart ever at ease because I acted in love?

> What does God see in me that I might be missing?

> When did my heart condemn me today because I failed to love?

> Where do I need His forgiveness, correction, or encouragement?

- Ask God for forgiveness. Specifically confess the way(s) you missed the mark and trust Him for His forgiveness.

### 4.	Look Ahead (approximately 3 minutes)

- Think through the day ahead. 

> What interactions are you planning to have?

> What moments will you have by yourself? 

- Resolve to be with God and reflect His goodness and love in each situation.

### 5.	Abide in Him (approximately 1 minute)

- Once again, take deep breaths as you invite the Holy Spirit to fill you. 

- Ask Him to give you the virtue and wisdom you need for the coming day.

<b>Pray boldly:</b> “Father, help me love more and more effectively. Show me who needs love tomorrow. Give me confidence to ask You for what I need. Abide in me so love can flow through me.”
