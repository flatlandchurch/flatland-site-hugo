## Visit a Sunday Service

### 9:30 and 11:00 AM

Flatland is all about moving people to the center of God’s kingdom. Through creative presentations and messages you will discover what God’s kingdom is all about. You will also discover how being a part of God's kingdom will transform your life in a powerful way.

If you're new to the area, new to church, or looking for a new start, our Sunday morning services offer the opportunity to be transformed and grow deeper in your walk with Christ. We currently have worship services at our Flatland 144 campus (144th & Larimore) on Sundays at 9:30 and 11:00am.

## Our Values

There are a few things that just make us _us_. We call them values, and we have five of them that define the way we do ministry, the team we surround ourselves with, and the leaders we put in place.

### Authenticity

Jesus has always been about meeting people where they are. No fronts or facades. We strive for authenticity in every aspect of Flatland Church, from the moment you step on our campus to the last song sung, we want you to see who we really are, and we want to see the real you.

### Enthusiasm

Enthusiasm is the belief in the special revelations of the Holy Spirit. We believe that God moves toward us when we draw near to Him.

### Love

Love has always been at the core of Christ’s mission here on Earth. Jesus told his disciples in [John 13:35](http://biblehub.com/john/13-35.htm) that the world will know we are his disciples by our love for one another. We strive to have an environment of love and respect for one another, where needs are met and relationships flourish. One of the best ways to experience meaningful Christian relationships here at Flatland Church is to join a life group.

### Collaboration

Here at Flatland Church we know we can’t do this journey to the center of God’s Kingdom alone. That’s why we value collaboration in everything we do.

### Transformation

In [2 Corinthians 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:18) the Apostle Paul encourages his friends at a church in Greece to continue being transformed from glory to glory. We value life transformation here at Flatland Church. We believe that becoming more like God and moving closer to the center of His Kingdom is a life-long journey. We desire to equip you for the journey through inspiring teaching, educational class, and regular life coaching.
