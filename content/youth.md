Flatland Student Ministry, or FSM612, meets every Wednesday night at [Flatland 144](/locations/flatland-144). Youth services are structured much the same way as our Sunday morning services, with a message upfront, followed by responding to God in worship. The change-up is that we also provided time and space for students to meet in small groups. This gives an opportunity for students to dig deeper into the message they just heard, and discuss it with peers and leaders.
