Our children's ministry is available during both of our Sunday morning services.

FlatKids is the Flatland Church ministry for children birth to 5th Grade. Flatland Children’s Ministry department is based on Bible education, spiritual experience and practical application. Each child who begins their faith journey in our preschool program and ends in 5th grade will go through the Bible 8 times learning Bible stories, Biblical principles and how to know God personally. It is our desire to partner with parents to disciple their children. Each child is provided a take home paper with additional home activities coordinating with the week’s lesson.

Our FlatKid’s facility is specially designed for kids. Each room is brightly colored and equipped with age appropriate toys and activities. The highlight of our elementary area is a custom rock climbing wall. Our FlatKid’s area can only be accessed by one entry point and is staffed with security at all times. All staff and team members are background checked and screened prior to working with our Flatland children.

### FlatKid’s Nursery (Birth – 3 years old)

Our nursery is staffed by parents and individuals who love the littlest of children. We strive to have a safe and caring environment that introduces children to God through loving care. You can drop your child off and enjoy the main adult service knowing your child is well taken care of. If any issue arises we will text a parent/guardian as needed.

### FlatKid’s Juniors (3 years – 5 years old)

Our preschool ministry is fast moving and fun. Each week preschoolers will learn a Bible story, worship through song and dance, and have a hands-on activity. Children will also be encouraged to pray for one another. Children are never too young to begin their faith journey.

### FlatKid’s Elementary (Kindergarten – 5th Grade)

For our elementary FlatKid’s we use TRUFIRE curriculum. Each week the kids experience a large group Bible lesson and truth along with a worship time. Children also have an age appropriate small group time for discussion and prayer together.  Children are encouraged to bring their Bible, bring a friend and memorize weekly Bible verses. Tokens can be earned and used at the FlatKid’s Store.

### Other Children’s Activities:

Summer Kid’s Camp: FlatKid’s, going in 2nd grade – 5th grade can attend our Summer Kid’s Camp in Lexington, Nebraska each June.

High-Five Class: Every April/May children ending their 5th grade year have a special 6 week class taught by our youth pastor, Codey Friesen. The mission of the High Five Course is to help students move easily and comfortably from children's ministry to youth ministry. All those who successfully complete this class will be able to attend Youth Camp for free.
