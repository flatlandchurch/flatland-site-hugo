At Flatland Church we want to see kids and adults develop a life-long relationship with King Jesus practiced in a continued movement toward the center of God's Kingdom. To that end, we offer age-specific ministry for kids from Kindergarten to 5th Grade on Sunday mornings.

## Curriculum

We desire to see kids develop an imagination that is rooted in the Scriptures. Our curriculum endeavors to take children through the grand narrative of the Bible in a two-year cycle, with stories told at age-appropriate levels.

## Team

We have a fully volunteer team trained in our curriculum and fully background checked. Each member of our team has a heart for children and a desire to help them move closer to the center of God's Kingdom.
