## The Gift of the Spirit is for You

_by Bart Wilkins, Lead Pastor at Flatland Church_

**God has a gift for you.**

I rejected a gift from a friend once.

It wasn’t a good idea, but I did it anyway.

Have you ever received a gift that forces you to control your facial expressions? You open the gift, and various thoughts and questions flood your brain.

> “There’s no way I can use this.”

> “What am I going to do with this?”

> “There’s no way I would ever put this on!”

A friend of mine carved a wall hanging out of wood for me. When I caught wind that he was making it, I panicked. There was a wall I thought he was making it for, and I had other plans for that wall. When he finally presented the gift to me, I rejected it. He was devastated, and left with his gift in tow. I later told him I had other plans for that wall. When he told me that he was never concerned with where I put it, I was utterly embarrassed by my response. I vowed then and there to accept heart-felt gifts from friends, even if I didn’t believe I could use them.

It is amazing to think that anyone would refuse something God was offering, yet that is exactly what far too many people do. Every day, the gospel is preached and people reject His gift of salvation. People reject God’s gift of wisdom by refusing to study the Bible. People reject a life of virtue by quenching the gift of His transforming power.

**There is one primary reason we reject any one of God’s gifts. We lack faith.**

When a person does not believe that Jesus is the risen Son of God, they reject salvation. When a person does not believe the Bible is relevant for today, they refuse to study it. When a person does not believe that God’s power can help them live the abundant life Jesus promised, they decide not to walk with Him. In that same way, many Christians reject the gift of tongues because they lack faith. They politely refuse this gift from God for one or more of the following reasons:
 
- They don’t know what it is.
- They don’t believe it is for today.
- They don’t believe it is for every believer.
- They don’t believe it will make any difference.

Yet this is the one unique gift of the Spirit made available in the New Testament. After His resurrection and just before His ascension, Jesus told His disciples to go to Jerusalem and wait for the gift God promised.[^1] They did so, and several days later they were baptized with the Holy Spirit.[^2] At that moment they also received the gift of tongues. Several years later, the Apostle Paul gave instructions for orderly worship in the church of Corinth. In his instructions he made a couple of eye-opening statements. “I want you all to speak in tongues,”[^3] and “do not forbid speaking in tongues.”[^4]

Unfortunately, the gift of tongues has been confused, misused, and even abused in the church, much like it was in the early Corinthian church. After all, that is one of the reasons Paul felt compelled to write his letter to that church. It is a mysterious gift, and there are numerous and conflicting views about its relevance and use today. I have now used the gift of tongues for more than 40 years. It has had a tremendous impact in my life and in my walk with the Holy Spirit. Hopefully, what little understanding I can share with you regarding this marvelous gift from God will inspire you to seek it, receive it, and use it for the rest of your life.

**What is this gift of tongues?**

Simply put, it is the Holy Spirit empowered ability to speak in a language that has not
been learned. When speaking in this unlearned language, the speakers are declaring
the greatness of God even though they do not understand what they are saying.
The first time this occurred was in Jerusalem shortly after Jesus ascended into heaven.
Approximately 120 believers were praying together when they were filled with the Holy
Spirit. It is recorded for us in Acts 2:1-4.

> When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. 3And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. (ESV)

Similar experiences are recorded later in the book of Acts. In chapter 10, Cornelius, a Roman centurion, is given the gift of tongues along with his entire household.[^5] In chapter 19, a group of 12 believers in Ephesus receive the gift when Paul laid his hands on them.[^6]

**Is the gift of tongues available today?**

Yes. Millions of believers around the world have the gift of tongues today. There are many pastors and teachers, however, who adamantly say it is not for today. With a quick search on the internet you can find numerous sites that argue the gift of tongues was only for the early church, and that any use today is at best delusional, and at worst ungodly. It’s no wonder that many believers today avoid and reject this mysterious gift.

I am not exactly sure why so many are opposed to the gift of tongues. Perhaps they have been offended by Christians who flaunted or abused the gift. Perhaps they reject the gift because it is so mysterious and difficult to understand. Perhaps they prayed to receive the gift and gave up when it was not received right away.

Whatever the reason, the primary passage people use to claim the gift is not for today is 1 Corinthians 13:8-10.

> Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. (ESV)

At stake is the interpretation of the phrase, “when the perfect comes.” Those who argue that the gift of tongues has ceased believe “the perfect” refers to the scriptures: the finished Bible that has now come to us. At this point, prophecy, tongues and knowledge were no longer needed.

Those of us who use the gift of tongues interpret this passage differently. We believe that “when the perfect comes” refers to the second coming of Jesus Christ, the perfect One. We believe this because of what is said in the verses that immediately follow:

> When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. (1 Corinthians 13:11-12, ESV)

Until we see Jesus face to face, we are like children. We know in part and see things dimly, even though we have the scriptures to help us along. When Jesus comes again, we will see Him face to face. We will know fully, just as He has always fully known us. Until Jesus comes again, we believe that the Holy Spirit, along with all of His gifts, are available to us and should be used properly for the building up of the church. The scriptures were never meant to replace the work, instruction, guidance and power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. Rather, they offer authoritative guidance and clarity as we seek to walk in step with the Spirit through faith in Jesus Christ.

**Is the gift of tongues available to every believer?**

I answer this question with a resounding “Yes!” But for anyone who has read about tongues in the Bible, it is clear that I have some explaining to do. “Isn’t the Bible perfectly clear on this?” they ask. Simply look at 1 Corinthians 12:28-30.

> And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? (ESV)

The implied answer to these questions is “no.” According to this, it seems to be clear that not every believer will speak with tongues in the same way that not every believer will be an apostle. How then can I say that speaking in tongues is for every believer? In 1 Corinthians 12-14, Paul outlines the best use of spiritual gifts in the church. He points out problematic situations and offers guidelines to correct their poor use of spiritual gifts. In chapter 12, Paul states that the manifestations of the Spirit are for the common good.[^7] He equates the body of Christ to a physical body. To be healthy and whole, we need all the parts functioning properly together. With this in mind, Paul tells us that when we come together as a church, everyone should bring a variety of gifts for the common good. In this sense, not everyone will bring a gift of tongues. We also need leadership, teaching, administration, healing, prophecy and more.

In the Corinthian church, it seems that all of them had received the gift of tongues. The problem wasn’t that they all had the gift of tongues. The problem was that they spoke in tongues at improper times. By way of rebuke, Paul asks this question in 1 Corinthians 14:23.

> If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and
outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
(ESV)

As stated before, Paul told the church in Corinth, “I want you all to speak in tongues.” In church services, however, not everyone should use their gift of tongues. Bring other gifts as the Holy Spirit enables for the building up of the church, especially the gift of prophecy.[^8]

**Why do I need the gift of tongues?**

The reason you need the gift of tongues is also another reason I believe it is available to  every believer. Here’s what Paul said about the gift of tongues in 1 Corinthians 14:2

> For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one
understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. (ESV)

Tongues allows the believer to pray perfect prayers to God.

Throughout my life, I have heard numerous stories of people who were praying in tongues that were interpreted by people who spoke different languages. My father was one of them. He was pastoring a small church in Nebraska, and they were having a prayer meeting at the church one night. Another minister from the community and his wife often came to these prayer meetings. This pastor’s wife heard my dad praying in tongues that evening and was able to interpret his prayers because she heard him praying in Spanish. She grew up in South America as a missionary’s kid, and my dad was praising God in the dialect she had learned growing up. She later told him it was the most beautiful prayer she had ever heard.

Praying in tongues, however, is not only about uttering perfect, beautiful mysteries in the Spirit. It also edifies the person who does the praying. Here’s what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14:4.

> The one who speaks in a tongue builds up [strengthens, edifies] himself. (ESV)

He gives no further description of this. In fact, it comes across as though this was obvious to his readers. If in fact they all spoke in tongues, this would not be news to them.

So let me share some of the ways I am edified by praying in tongues on a regular basis. I’m sure other believers who speak in tongues would have their own unique responses. I’ll be the first to admit these are based on experience and not necessarily on scripture. However, I believe you’ll agree these are in line with what God desires for every believer according to his word.

First and foremost, speaking in tongues requires the believer to be surrendered before God. When I pray in tongues, I am relinquishing control of my life to God. The more I pray in tongues, the more I find myself surrendered to His will throughout the day. When we humble ourselves before the Lord, He exalts us.[^9] He edifies us.

Another great thing about praying in tongues is that my tongue is tamed. James, the brother of Jesus, acknowledged that no one can truly tame the tongue.[^10] When I pray in tongues, the Spirit does what I cannot do. The more I pray in tongues, the more self-control, kindness, and gentleness are produced in my life by the Spirit.

Praying without knowing what I’m saying is a constant reminder to me of how little I truly know about God. I am so grateful for the scriptures that reveal God’s plan of salvation and life through Jesus Christ. But even if I memorize it cover to cover and do all that it says, mysteries about God remain that are so far beyond me. He is the God of the impossible.

There is also an empowering aspect of praying in tongues. The same power that raised Jesus from the dead is working miraculously in me. If I walk in step with the Spirit—giving Him control, offering Him my tongue, believing Him for the impossible—how can He not then equip me to live for Christ and share the good news with boldness.

Praying in tongues also allows me to enjoy the presence of the Holy Spirit in a very personal, intimate and unique way. I love to worship God, singing praises alongside fellow believers. I’m built up when I study the Bible. Spending time praying, laughing, and hanging out with other believers is incredible. These all encourage my faith and help me feel close to God. But there’s nothing quite like the moments I spend each day with the Holy Spirit allowing Him to fill me and pray to the Father through me.

If you want to live a life surrendered to God, empowered to serve, and filled with His presence, then the gift of tongues is for you. You have likely experienced all of these without the gift of tongues. This gift, however, will take these to new levels in your walk with God.

**Does the gift of tongues always need an interpretation?**

No, it does not. In fact, the vast majority of prayers spoken in tongues go uninterpreted. This is because most of the tongues spoken are in private. Here’s what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14:18-19.

> I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. Nevertheless, in church
I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten
thousand words in a tongue. (ESV)

Paul regularly spoke in tongues when praying privately to God. But he recognized that in the church tongues didn’t build anyone up, unless they were interpreted. Prophecy always built people up, so when the church is gathered together, that gift is of greater effectiveness, unless the message in tongues is interpreted.[^11]

Interpretation of tongues also does not appear to be of necessity when someone first receives the gift. In Acts 2, people from various countries were present when the believers began speaking in tongues. As a result, the foreigners were able to interpret what was being said in their own languages.[^12] However, in Acts 10 and 19, no interpretation was given when the new believers received the gift of tongues.

On a practical note, there will always be a bit of trial and error when it comes to speaking in tongues with other believers. For instance, how will I know if there is someone able to interpret unless I’ve spoken aloud in tongues? How will I know if I have the gift of interpretation if no one speaks aloud in tongues? The key here is to be in an environment of faith and grace as we seek to use the precious gifts the Holy Spirit manifests in us. Believers must also be gentle and humble in using the gifts in order to receive correction and direction by those leading the gatherings.[^13]

**How do I receive the gift of tongues?**

Consider the following instructions from Jesus. The first is from Matthew 7:7-11. The second is from Luke 11:9-13.

> “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened
to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!” (ESV)

> “And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it
will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks
finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. What father among you, if his
son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg,
will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to
your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those
who ask him!” (ESV)

It is the desire of the Father to give the Holy Spirit, along with the Spirit’s gifts, to those who ask. Jesus told His disciples to go and wait for the gift God promised.[^14] Paul instructed his audience to eagerly desire spiritual gifts.[^15]

It seems through scripture and experience that God’s will is for us to desire, to ask and to wait. If you do not desire the gift of tongues, you will not receive it. It will never be forced on you, and God will certainly not make your mouth move or speak the words for you. If you do not ask for it, you will not receive it. We call it a gift, but it is inevitably a gift that must be requested. It is not something that just appears. If you do not wait for it, you will miss it. The willingness to wait is the evidence of the desire to receive.

The scriptures are silent on just how a person receiving the gift of tongues knows when and what to speak. There is no formula or instruction given. Therefore, the experiences of those who have received the gift become rather helpful. In virtually every conversation I have had with people who have received the gift, the words simply formed in their mind and they began speaking them out in faith.

It is not too different from speaking words of praise to God in my natural language. I want to praise Him, and words begin to form in my mind. For instance, this sentence may come to mind: “Heavenly Father, You are magnificent.” Even as these words come to mind, I speak them in praise to God. The transition from mind to mouth is almost instantaneous. Speaking in tongues is much the same. A word of praise that I cannot understand forms in my mind, and so I speak it out in faith to God. As one word is formed and spoken, another comes right behind it. Before long, sentence after sentence pours out of my mouth by way of the Spirit within me. I do not understand a single word I am saying, but I simultaneously recognize that marvelous prayers of praise and petition are being offered up to God.

Through the years, I have prayed with many people to receive the gift of tongues. I have also observed other people pray with people to receive the gift of tongues. Everyone’s experience is unique, and some can be vastly different. One person begins speaking in tongues in an instant. Another person may wait for quite some time. One person receives the gift in a prayer meeting. Another person receives the gift when they are all alone. On many occasions, people with whom I prayed call me hours or days later saying they began speaking in tongues in their living room, in their car, in the shower, out on a walk, or at a number of other places. Some spoke in tongues for a minute or two. Some for hours.

Furthermore, the emotions and thoughts people experience when it happens are equally varied. Some laugh. Some weep. Some are excited and overjoyed. Some are stoic and analytical. There is no telling how you will respond when you experience the gift for the very first time. And there is really no right or wrong response. It simply is what it is.

**Are you ready to ask, seek and knock?**

Begin asking God to fill you with His Holy Spirit and give you this extraordinary gift. It is not something to be earned. It is also not something you seek for selfish gain or spiritual superiority. On the contrary, it is an act of surrender. It is born out of a longing for a deeper relationship with the Holy Spirit and a stronger walk with God. Furthermore, it is only available to those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ and confessed Him as Lord of their lives.

If you have put your faith in Jesus and desire to walk more closely with the Spirit He gave, here are some additional ways you can prepare your heart and mind to receive the gift of tongues. These are not necessarily required, nor are they a formula to receive. They are simply a list of ideas to help you ask, seek and knock.

- Get used to hearing yourself talk to God. Pray out loud. Read scripture out loud.
- Spend time in prayer with people who have received the gift of tongues.
- Ask someone who has received the gift of tongues to share their story with you. Find out when, where and how they received it.
- Have a conversation with someone about Jesus. After all, the gifts of the Spirit are meant to help us share the gospel and build up other believers.
- Enter into a fast as you ask to receive the gift of tongues.

May God richly bless you as you pursue a deeper walk with Him. No matter how long it takes to receive the gift of tongues, God is at work. There are many things He desires to do in your life in addition to this gift. Seek the giver more than any of His gifts, and you will live a truly blessed life.
