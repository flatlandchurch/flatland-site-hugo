The cornerstone is the first stone set in the construction of a foundation, important since all other stones will be set in reference to this stone, thus determining the position of the entire structure.  When a building goes up, putting in the cornerstone is a big deal and people celebrate.  Many cornerstones are engraved with historical information about the building, such as the year the building was built. 

If Christianity had a literal cornerstone in its foundation, the engraving would read “33 AD”.  The event which occurred during this year was a big deal, and people celebrated.  It was not the birth of Christ, nor his ministry, nor the miracles he performed, nor his death.  The cornerstone was the resurrection.  

Some religions adorn their churches and homes with the crucifix, signifying a painful event which was not celebrated by his followers.  They of little faith, consumed with grief, experienced the birth of real faith when the tomb was found empty three days later, confirming everything their Lord had told them.  This is the celebration.  Perhaps the crucifix should be replaced with an empty tomb.

> _Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead--by this name this man stands here before you in good health. "He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone. "And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."_ -[Acts 4:10-12][1]

**Your task**:  Play a game of Jenga.  What happens when you remove a crucial piece of the tower you have built.  What will happen if you reject the resurrection?  Challenge yourself to rejoice in the cornerstone daily.
