### [Luke 12:22-34][1]

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs is presented in a pyramid form, with basic physiological needs in the wider shape at the bottom, and other needs progressing upward to self-fulfillment at the narrower top.  The pyramid asserts that the needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up.

But Jesus said, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.  For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.  [Luke 12: 22-23][1]

I believe Jesus would say that Maslow had it backwards, that his hierarchy was self-centered, entitled, even narcissistic.  Not that we don’t need all those things, but that they all can be realized through the kingdom God has given us, and that self-actualization in Christ must be satisfied before we can attend to the needs higher up.

Perhaps Jesus’s Hierarchy of Human Needs would look more like this:

> _“Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.”_  [Luke 12:32][1]

### Questions:
1. What does your hierarchy of needs look like?  Can you place your physiological needs at the top, and start at the bottom with your identity in Christ?
2. Are you enjoying the treasures of God’s kingdom, or does your pleasure lie in material things of this world?  What can you let go of, in order to embrace the treasures God has freely given you?
