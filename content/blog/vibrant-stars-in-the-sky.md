### [Philippians 2:14-30][1]

"Do everything without grumbling or arguing...." Paul was recalling the first generation of Israelites that was rescued by God from Egypt. Despite all the great miracles bestowed upon the children, they were constantly grumbling and arguing. As such, at the end of his life, Moses recites a song saying that that generation was _not_ God's children ([Deuteronomy 32][2] cf. Phil. 2:15). As such, they died without ever seeing the promised land. Paul doesn't want to see the Philippians follow in those same footsteps.

It is very plain from reading the history of Israel in the OT, that generation after generation they would forget that they were children of God and go chasing after other gods. They would grumble and complain that God the Father wasn't providing them with enough stuff and maybe, just maybe, one of the other gods would. Throughout our lives, we will encounter times when we feel like we don't have the stuff that we need. We may grumble and argue with God. We may feel that there must be something other than following the way of the Father that will help us get that stuff. We take our eyes off God, off of moving to the center of His grace. If we are not diligent, we could find ourselves wandering in the desert.

God is there for us. He will provide everything we need. If we will "do everything without grumbling or arguing" holding "firmly to the word of life", against the backdrop of the black, warped and crooked world we will "shine among them like stars in the sky".

> _I will proclaim the name of the Lord.
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, praise the greatness of our God!
> He is the Rock, his works are perfect,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;and all his ways are just.
> A faithful God who does no wrong,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;upright and just is he._ -[Deuteronomy 32:3-4][2]
