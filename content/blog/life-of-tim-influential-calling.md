[**2 Timothy 2:1-14**][1]

Paul refers to Timothy as his “son”. This is not because Timothy was born a child to him, but because he is Paul’s deeply loved disciple (Hebrew [talmid][2]), for which contemporary Western thinking has no analog.  A talmid of Jesus’ day would answer the call to serve the Lord by giving up his entire life in order to be with his teacher. The student, would attach himself to and travel with the rabbi as part of his education. His goal was to become like his rabbi and learn his [halakha][3] until he internalized it. This continued until he became a full-fledged rabbi or scribe at the age of thirty.

In our culture, we earnestly seek out education, for example, from a college professor. And, periodically, we receive on the job training from our employer. However, as soon as “class is dismissed” we can’t wait to return to our life apart from this education format. In these cases, we value the comfort of our life routine over our life calling. Consider Paul here living in his Rabbi’s (Jesus’) footsteps. Note that Paul’s mentoring employs the pattern of education that is never intended to get us back to our previous life. He’s inviting us into so much more. He’s inviting us into Jesus’ life.

When Jesus tells us to [go make disciples/talmid of people throughout the world][4], He’s calling us to first dedicate ourselves to the task of living, eating, sleeping, working, playing, loving, suffering, bleeding, and breathing every moment of our lives with God so that His deepest purpose becomes ours, or better, that we become His purpose. Paul loved to call Timothy his beloved son. But, with even greater desire for intimacy, God Himself is longing for you to answer to His calling you His beloved talmid so that you can share in His love and call even more talmid to Him. It won’t be easy, our Master was never about easy, but living for Jesus beats every alternative.
