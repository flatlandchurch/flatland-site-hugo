There is a constant theme throughout the Bible, love is the fulfillment of all religious requirements. 

What is a proper fast? 
> _Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter – when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?_ ([Isaiah‬ ‭58:7‬ ‭NIV][1])‬‬ 

When we come together to worship God, what is our proper attitude? 
> _If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself,’ you are doing right. But if you show favouritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as law-breakers._ ‭‭([James‬ ‭2:1-9][2]‬) 

When we serve Jesus as our Lord and Savior what does that look like?  Jesus said, 
> _For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was ill and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.... Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me._ ‭‭([Matthew‬ ‭25:31-46][3])

As Christians we have a challenge, how do we deal with the hot topic of immigration? I think the answer has already been stated, we must love and welcome immigrants into our lives. God calls us to care for those in need and that includes the ones coming into our country seeking a better life. Yes, there are a lot of legal issues involved that we can't address directly but we can address our hearts and minds. We must be welcoming, we must be caring, we must show God’s love to all. 

> _When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not ill-treat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners… I am the LORD your God._ -[Leviticus‬ ‭19:33-34‬ ‭NIV][4]
