**[James 1:9-19][1]**

I read a book where the child complained that he didn’t get as many presents as he had the previous year. Spoiled to the max, the parents gave him more. Of course, the child quickly abandoned those much begged gifts, broken, bruised and lost. The gifts were temporary.

James is fairly tough on the rich. The problem isn’t that they are rich but that they place their energy and hope in their wealth. They are living on easy street not any facing problems. James points out that wealth is fleeting so that when you put your hope in the temporary, they _will_ crumble into dust. On the other hand, those that put their trust in the Lord despite the difficulties they face will receive a reward that will last forever.

Jesus declared “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God... But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort” ([Luke 6:20-26][2]). It is a simple equation, grit it out in this life living for Christ in faith to spend eternity in riches or take it easy in riches in this life without Christ and well, that’s it, you got everything you get for eternity. It’s showtime, got grit?

> _Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created._ -James 1:16-18 NIV
