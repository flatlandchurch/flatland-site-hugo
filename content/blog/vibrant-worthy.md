### [Philippians 1][1]

Paul challenges us in Philippians 1:27 to conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ even when faced with major suffering and persecution. He challenges us to do this that we might bear fruit. Paul could say this, he was in prison yet he was bearing fruit (v12-14) and he wants us to do the same, no matter what our circumstances.

The question is how? The answer found in Philippians 1 is simple, God will help us "being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus" Philippians‬ ‭1:6‬ ‭NIV. We bear fruit because it "comes through Jesus Christ – to the glory and praise of God." Philippians. ‭1:11‬

Another aspect of the answer we find in Philippians 1:27, the phrase "striving together as one". We will struggle and fall if we are standing alone. But as we gather together not only on Sundays but for life groups, life coaching, and just general get togethers with friends from Flatland we will build each other up as we encourage one another in the Lord. We can not do it alone. With the support of our Christ-like friends and help from the Lord, we can live lives worthy of the Gospel and be the answer to Paul's prayer in vs 9-11, what we do will be "to the glory and praise of God".

> _That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,_<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_which yields its fruit in season_ <br>
>  _and whose leaf does not wither_ <br>
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;_– whatever they do prospers._ -[Psalm‬ ‭1:3‬‬‬][2]

### Questions
1. Do you find it easy or hard to rely on someone else? What makes it easier to rely on someone else?
2. What is you motivation in life? Bear eternal fruit for God or aquire temporary stuff now?
3. What steps can you take to live in a manner worthy of the gospel?
