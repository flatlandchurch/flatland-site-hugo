Accountability is being responsible for one’s own actions.  The law holds us accountable for following traffic rules.  If we speed we may get a ticket; if we’re lucky, a warning.  Those with addictions may belong to a support group, where a sponsor is assigned to keep them accountable to the abstinence of the addiction. A student is accountable to his instructor, to whom he must turn in assignments which are done correctly.  The instructor provides instruction and feedback to help the student improve in quality. 

Who keeps you accountable for leading a life led by Christ?  Ultimately we are accountable to our Lord and leader himself. _So then each of us shall give account of himself to God._ ([Romans 14:12][rom14]).  But God never meant for us to get through our journey on this planet alone, that’s why he didn’t stop with Adam.  _The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”_ ([Genesis 2:18][gen2]) And thus started the lineage of Adam, the creation of a people, and no reason for anyone to be alone in their struggles. 

When I first started coming to Flatland, I was in a dark place and was looking for a connection with God, guidance from Him in my struggle.  I wasn’t interested in meeting anyone, I didn’t want to tell my story, I didn’t want advice as I was tired of being told what I should do.  I only wanted that advice from God. So I lived my journey alone in that seat in the auditorium, listening to Bart’s messages, praying while the worship team played their role, and hearing from God.  And I got my answers from my Lord and leader and with His guidance made the tough decisions I needed to make.  But as I continued on my journey I eventually took the next step and opened myself up to not only hearing from God, but hearing from others, outside that seat in the auditorium.  

_Yes_, we are ultimately accountable to God, _**but**_ we need people along the way to help us stay in integrity.  We become accountable to them for our actions and they to us as we are all a part of the Body of Christ. We work together for the common good, to lead others to Christ and to build each other in Christ.

> _Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it._  -[1 Corinthians 12:27][1co12]

* Who are your people?  How do they hold you accountable to leading a Christ-filled life? 
* Are you that person to someone else?  If not, God is calling you today to be someone’s person.
