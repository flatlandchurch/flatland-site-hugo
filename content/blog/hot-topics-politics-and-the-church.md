[**1 Timothy 2:1-4**][1]

And we’re off and running full speed into topics that can become too hot to handle if not done well. One question we ask ourselves is: “Should people of faith be involved in politics in the first place? Well, of course we should. But the goal of Christians who are involved should be [different from the goal of the world.][2]

The world wants politics and political figures to solve their problems. This mindset just leaves them in a constant state of frustration. Politicians haven’t even met me, so they can’t know my specific problem nor what they could do [that would completely satisfy me.][3] Furthermore, when it comes to deep moral issues, we want people with political power to take action on issues in a way that honors God.  In other words, we want them to pass laws that forbid breaking God’s commands.

As believers in Christ, being involed in politics means we can run for office and bring our integrity, by the grace of our Lord, to our office. It means we can write to our leaders and express our concerns for the state of our union. In our communication, we can cite the Declaration of Independence which says, in part, that people in the United States do hold certain truths to be “self-evident”. 

But in addition to, and above all other things, we can and must spread the Gospel. In our daily prayer, we Christians should be intercessors for those in office – daily and lovingly caring about and praying for their salvation. In this way, we not only save them from an eternity apart from our loving God but, once saved, they will have dwelling within them the power of the Holy Spirit including supernatural understanding and the ability to do good works.

Loving our leaders is what pleases God. Let’s attract them by our love for all people and let God save them though that attractive loving door we’ve opened up to them.

**Instructions about Worship:**

> _I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. This is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth._ [1 Timothy 2:1-4 (NLT)][1]
