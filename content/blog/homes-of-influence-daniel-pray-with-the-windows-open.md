[**Daniel 1**][1]

[**Daniel 6**][1]

Daniel’s colleagues, knowing of his pure faith in God, attempted to destroy him by convincing King Darius to issue a decree forbidding worship to anyone besides the king for thirty days.  Anyone found disobeying the decree would be thrown in the lion’s den.

One would think this story has two possible outcomes...Either Daniel stays safe by abstaining from Godly worship, or he worships God and suffers death in the lion’s den.  But outcome two has a twist.  Yes, Daniel worships God, three times a day as he always does, and he does so with the windows open.  He is thrown into the lion’s den, but because of his enduring faith God sends his angel to shut the mouths of the lions.

Daniel was not afraid to disobey human law in order to stay in obedience to God.  The attempt of his coworkers to bring him down failed as he remained steadfast in his faith, not only continuing to pray multiple times a day, but refusing to hide it.

When was the last time you prayed with the windows open?

> _Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine._ ~Exodus 19:5
