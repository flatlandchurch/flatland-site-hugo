#### [John 11:40-44][1]

Have you been damaged by someone else? If so, a part of you died on that date. Your joy, peace, enthusiasm, love, trust, faith, and maybe even something else just as damaging could have been killed off. And you just can’t get it back, at least in your current life. As a result, your life can be hard to bear at times. You may frequently relive these past experiences and you may keep “re-feeling” the pain. If so, symptoms such as anger, frustration, depression, anxiety, resentment, stress, etc. could be recurring, if not routine experiences for you. So, what are your options?

One common option we choose when we feel pain is to seek physical relief before the thought of Spiritual healing ever enters our minds. In a world where symptoms are dulled by medication, alcohol, drugs, gambling, sex, etc. we lose our ambition to discover, face, and deal with what’s causing our symptoms. In this dulled state, we get to the point where it’s like we’re going along in life as if on some kiddie ride at an amusement park instead of joining the rest of the world on the roller coaster journey; a journey which includes joining our loved ones in the very natural experiences of life’s ups and downs. Neither party is completely satisfied, but then again, there’s always a better life _after_ the resurrection that we can look forward to.

Re-living our old life and dulling our pain instead of enthusiastically seeking and embracing new life transformation makes Jesus sad. [He weeps for us][2] when the world of darkness prevents us from seeing that our resurrection to new life is actually for the here and now. Jesus said it Himself; [“I AM the resurrection…”.][3] He doesn’t ever say “I _will be_ the resurrection”. Jesus has already bought and paid for your new life at the great expense of His own. [The work is already done.][4] It’s time to walk out of your tomb.

### Challenges
- What part or parts of you have died?
- Have you convinced yourself that you’re waiting on Jesus to give you a brand-new life in freedom from all old hurts, dents, scratches, and characteristics?
- Are you finally ready to see that Jesus is, at this very moment, holding out your new life and He’s the one waiting on you to accept it?
