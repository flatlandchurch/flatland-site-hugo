[**Today’s Reading: John 6:1-21 – Feeding Five Thousand**][jhn6]

Today, Jesus crosses over to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee. Luke identifies the location of their landing as Bethsaida, which would be the Northernmost point of the sea ([Luke 9:10][luk910]).  A great crowd follows Jesus, presumably by foot. When Jesus sees them approaching, He’s filled with compassion and asks Phillip to consider how they may be fed. Phillip, although he has witnessed the miracles of his Master, doesn’t even see the solution right in front of his eyes.  Andrew, on the other hand, gathers all that he can, in this case five small loaves and two small fish, and offers it all to Jesus.

The details in this passage are so familiar among Christians and historians that it would be hard to find someone who hasn’t heard that Jesus gives this crowd all that they can eat (V11). Although the number of men is clear, (five thousand) the total number is conservatively estimated as double or triple the number of men, considering that women and children weren’t counted, according to custom.  Even after each has had his or her fill, twelve basketful of leftovers are then gathered, presumably one being carried around by each disciple. In this miracle, Jesus shows He not only meets our need, but surpasses it in abundance.

It’s now evening and Jesus dismisses His disciples to sail back to Capernaum, an 8 mile trip.  When they have rowed nearly halfway there (v19), Jesus appears in the dim light of the moon and they fear that which they can’t yet recognize.  Nevertheless, they are calmed by the very sound of Jesus’ voice and they are instantly transported to Capernaum. In walking on water, Jesus shows us He is Lord of physics. Jesus does not submit to physics, physics obey Jesus. What’s more, in transporting his disciples over 4 miles in an instant, Jesus reveals Himself as Lord over time and space.

What would it take for you to more fully trust in Jesus to meet your every need, and exceed your expectations?

> _With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith. We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ._ -[2 Thessalonians 1:11-12 (NIV)][2th1]
