#### [Exodus 3][1]
 
What do we believe about the Light, and if we now share in the Light, what are we to do with the Light? I’m glad you asked. Let’s start with who the Light is, just in case anyone else along the way asks. When Moses was exposed to, and subsequently sent out from [the Light of the Lord][3] to bring Light to Egypt, he wanted to be able to identify the Light. He asks what name he can use. “I Am” is the reply. Note the (traditional) King James Bible version on [this hyperlink][2] as well.

Please consider that God doesn’t say “I was” or “I will be”. He identifies Himself as the eternal; the one who was, is, and will forever be. He might as well say “I exist, because I AM”, and “I do what I do, because I Am”… That God “_is_” is never debated nor questioned in the Bible. God is always accepted as God because he _is_.

This week, we’re going to show how the Light (God) has been brought to earth, what happened because of this exposure, and naturally come to a conclusion about what this means to each of us personally.

### Challenges
- Do friends and/or family challenge you about the eternal existence of God? Are you dealing with any challenges of your own?
