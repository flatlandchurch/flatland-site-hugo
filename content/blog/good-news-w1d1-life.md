#### [John 1:1-4][1]
John starts his Gospel establishing that Jesus is God, creator of everything. He is the source of life. We owe our own existence to Jesus. Yet so many of us waste the gift given to us. I know I need to cut sugar out of my diet yet when presented with the opportunity to buy a big bag of gummy bears, it somehow appears in my shopping cart. Ack! I know what I should do for my physical life but even with that I am careless.

Then I think of eternal life. The world has completely abandoned what God freely has given. God created Adam and Eve as eternal beings. But they disobeyed God resulting in death being introduced, not only physical death but spiritual death, a complete separation from God for all eternity. God created life, mankind chose death. 

But [God loves us so much][j316] that through the death of His Son He gave us the opportunity of eternal life. It is the very reason He created us. It is the very reason He died for us. Jesus is the source of all life. We owe our lives to Jesus. We need to live for our Creator and give our lives over to Him who died that we might live. 

### Challenge
Is there something in your life you haven't given over to God? Will you?
