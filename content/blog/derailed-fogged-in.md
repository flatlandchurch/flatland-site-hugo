[**Philippians 3:17-18**][4]

It is funny how the brain works when one is not feeling well. Sunday I sat at home trying to [listen online][1] to Adam help us in our move to the center but got distracted by the sermon point displayed on the screen. I read it completely opposite of what it meant. Even when I said something online and was corrected, the wrong meaning still stuck in my head. But, I knew the correct meaning because others that I respect told me so that is what I stood firm on.

So, despite being potentially derailed by my fogged in brain, others kept me on the track providing a guiding light in the fog. Mentoring, coaching... actually, it is our brothers and sisters in Christ working with us in mentoring, coaching, life groups and other ministries that will keep us from being derailed if we but follow the [light of Christ][2] [that they exude][3].

> _You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven._ -[Matthew 5:14-16 (ESV)][3]
