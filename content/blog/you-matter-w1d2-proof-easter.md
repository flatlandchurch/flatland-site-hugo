#### [1 Corinthians 15][1cor15]

Easter is proof that you matter. God sacrificed His only Son for you. Yes, you! Don’t go looking around and say, “Yeah, maybe that person or that other person but not me.” Jesus said God loved **the world** to the extent that He made the ultimate sacrifice so that each one of us who believe might have eternal life. But, and this is a big but, God planned all of this before we believed, before we were born, [before He created the universe][eph1]. You matter because God did it all for you without you doing a single solitary thing.

It is important to see Easter in its whole. It starts on Friday when Jesus died for our sins. He took upon himself all our sins and bore the punishment that was due us. He [nailed all our sins][col214] and faults on the cross. And then He was buried. But it would have not been very efficacious if He stayed buried. The resurrection is key. Our whole faith depends on it. Paul makes this very clear in [1 Corinthians 15][1cor15]. The resurrection is the “I win!” momement. Even before we were born, we win, we matter.

The plan was set in motion before creation. You were known to God before time began. You matter to God for all eternity. You are at the center of God’s plan, to save you from your sins, to cleanse you from all impurities, to make you a new person. Will you accept the love of God? Will you believe?

### Challenge
- Meditate on the fact that God loves you as expressed in the cross and resurrection. You matter. How will you respond?
