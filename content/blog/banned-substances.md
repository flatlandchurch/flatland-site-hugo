### Stop Telling Rational Lies

Everybody lies.  Everyone has lied at some point.  Some people can see through them and others can't.  Regardless of the lies, there is one person who can see through them no matter what.  Jesus can see through them and knows exactly where our hearts are.  When we lie, there can be consequences.  Now, does this mean that every single lie that's ever told results is some disaster or tragedy?  Not at all.  Think of everything that's happening in Nebraska with the floods.  Are the floods being caused by someone who lied about something?  No.  The fact is we live in a fallen world that's continuing to deteriorate.  Bad things will continue to happen.  So, if bad things are going to happen, why do we follow Jesus?  Do we follow Him, so these bad things don't happen?  Unfortunately, Jesus doesn't promise that bad things will never happen.  He does promise that He'll be with us no matter what the circumstances are.


### Get to Know the Real Jesus

For Jesus to be with us through every circumstance, we need to get to know Him.  We need to know and learn that He cares about us.  How do we do this?  What's the next step?  Well, for those that haven't done it yet, the first step would be accepting Jesus as the Lord over your life.  To do this, we'll need to face what we've done in our past and then let Him take it.  After doing this, we need to continue to humble ourselves and sit at His feet.  Learning about Jesus and his character will help us learn more about ourselves and how we should treat other people.


### Live a Life of Repentance

> If we don't repent, we'll have a tough time with eternity. ~Pastor Bob Ireland

When we continue to repent for our sins and humble ourselves before God, we'll move closer to the center (as they say at Flatland).  Once we're closer to the center, we can help other people enter the circle and also move to the center.  So how do we move to the center?  Well, the Holy Spirit is here to help us.  He's like a GPS attempting to lead us to our final destination.  When we get off course, He'll try to correct our path by putting us back on it.  While the GPS may be impatient with us getting back on track, God is the opposite.

> The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. ~2 Peter 3:9

No matter where you're at in your life, as long as you've accepted Jesus, the Holy Spirit is with us at all times to guide us back to God's kingdom.  As long as we're ready to listen, we'll have opportunities to repent and move.


### Weekly Challenge Verse

*Create in me a pure heart, O God,
and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me from your presence
or take your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of your salvation
and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
~Psalm 51:10-12
