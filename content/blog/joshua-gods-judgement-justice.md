**[Joshua 9-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua9-12)**

Today, I asked the fellowship in Flatland's jail ministry how they benefit from the law.  There was a moment of silence.  I eventually broke the silence with a scenario of someone stealing their car and them notifying the police, including providing a clear description of the one who committed the crime. Now, I ask; "Suppose the police say 'Yes, stealing is breaking the law, but we don't do anything when people break the law…get over it…the car is theirs now'".  Using this absurd illustration, the benefit of justice was realized, even by those held the justice system.

We all benefit from justice, but in the absence of consequences, there is no justice.  Within these chapters of our history, we can be appalled by God's punishment techniques.  Furthermore, we can find it very challenging to defend our faith when others find it hard to believe in a God who would allow and even order such bloodbaths.  While we can't begin to fully comprehend the mind of God, who would actually be a small God if we could, we can wrap our minds around justice.  The people recounted in Chapter 12 had not only sinned against God (broken the law), but had hardened their hearts to the point of despising God and refusing to become reconciled with Him.

> I will sing of your love and justice; to you, Lord , I will sing praise. [Psalm 101:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm101:1)

1. As parents, or even as children of parents, we see the benefit of correction.  When you experience negative consequences of walking out of step with our Heavenly Father, do you flee from Him or turn back toward Him?
2. God's promise of an eternal "Promised-land" has not changed, the offer still stands. ([John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John3:16))  What has the cross done and what must you do to inherit this promise and avoid justice? (see [Hebrews 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews4))
