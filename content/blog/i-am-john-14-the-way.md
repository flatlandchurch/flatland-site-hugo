[**Today’s Reading: John 14 - I am the Way, Truth and Life**][jhn14]

“I am the way, the truth, and the life.” (vs 6) Jesus is our salvation, there is no other way. Because of who he is, amazing things can happen. He said, “Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” (vss 12-14)

We do have to read everything that Jesus said, “so that the Father may be glorified in the Son”. Asking for anything in Jesus’ name has a purpose and it isn’t to give us a cushy life although God does greatly care for us. Asking with selfish reasons will accomplish nothing ([James 4:3][jas43]). Asking that Jesus is lifted up, that people will come to Him for eternal life, that others may see the glory of God, that is the purpose of prayer.

God does greatly care for us. Jesus taught us to pray for our [daily bread][mat611]. Jesus taught us that [God will take care of us, no worries][mat625]. He said, “how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!” ([Matthew 7:11][mat711]) These thing bring glory to God. We should also be praying to do the works of Jesus, who healed the sick, brought hope to the lost, and fed thousands. We can believe in Him and know great things will happen because He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

> _I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith._

> _And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God._

> _Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen._ -[Ephesians 3:16-21][eph316]
