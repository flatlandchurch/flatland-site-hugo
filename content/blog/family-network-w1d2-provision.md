#### [Genesis 37:12-18][1]

Is there tension in your family network? Be honest. Are you getting along and being completely positive and supportive of each other at all times every day? I know I just don’t have that kind of energy. When I’m tired, or worse yet, exhausted, I’m far less able to respond to events with a positive attitude than when I’m well rested. I answer questions in terse tones or I ignore conversation altogether. I fail to lend a hand, even when it requires the least amount of effort. I’m not fun to be with. Am I alone here? Can anybody feel me? The truth is, I’m not alone in this. And we’re not weird.

[Jesus’ family network had tension.][2] So, to think we’re going to be immune from family tension is unrealistic. Therefore, how we handle the inevitable is what matters in keeping our family network intact. What we believe is critical here. If our family belief system is all over the map, we’ll have nothing to stand on together as a solid foundation. On the other hand, if we share a belief in God, and we share an absolute trust/faith in Him, we can sort through any challenge, knowing He will provide all that we need for continual restoration.

Believing that Jesus’ whole purpose in stepping out of Heaven--as perfect as it is--and into our incredible mess shows how much He cares about each of us. That He would experience being born a helpless baby who needed to learn to walk and talk and that He would experience first-hand what it feels like to be tempted by Satan is huge. That He would die an excruciating and violent death to save us from the power of Satan is [the greatest act of love anyone, including God, can show.][3] His whole mission on earth was to provide forgiveness so that He could keep His family together. We share a great Father in our God. Amen!

### Challenges
- What specific challenges prevent you from providing forgiveness among your family network?
- What challenges, if any, prevent you from placing your complete belief in God and in His abundant provision to keep your family network in tact?
