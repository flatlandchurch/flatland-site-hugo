Weeds can a problem in our yards and garden. So we grab weed killer and just start spraying. Next thing we know, there is a big brown spot in the middle of our yard where all the grass has died. **Yeah, read the instructions.** I don’t know how many times I have killed the grass only to have just weeds sprout up in its place. There is a time and a method to getting rid of weeds but in my impatience and frustration I do just the opposite.

[The devil is sneaky][1]. We get nice and comfy, gather around us Christian friends and family, and then [wham!][2], someone enters into our lives that causes all kinds of problems. They sap our strength, tempt us to give up bearing fruit for God, and we really wonder why God is allowing the evil to be among us. But there is a time, place, and method for weeding out the bad. We need to read the instructions, God’s Word.

We need to stand firm in God, soak up His Word to fertilize our minds, hearts and souls and be determined to bear fruit. What is so nifty about the weeds among us, unlike in gardening, we have an opportunity to lead them to the Lord. God can turn dandelions into beautiful flowers (or at least salads), thistles into wheat (or artichoke dip) as we allow God to shine through us.

**Challenge**
Pray for the one who is a weed in your life, that God may save them.

> _Blessed is the one  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not walk in step with the wicked  
or stand in the way that sinners take   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or sit in the company of mockers,   
but whose delight is in the law of the Lord ,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and who meditates on his law day and night.   
That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which yields its fruit in season   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and whose leaf does not wither—   
whatever they do prospers._ -[Psalms 1:1-3][3]
