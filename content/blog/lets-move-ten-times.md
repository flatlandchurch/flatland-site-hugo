“There is not one of you whom God could not bless ten times as much if you had ten times as much of the Spirit.” For it is not any ability of the man–it is not any human qualification–it is simply the influence of God’s Spirit that is necessary!" - Charles Spurgeon, _Holy Spirit_

When it comes to moving to the center Charles Spurgeon says it well. No matter how good we may be, we are nothing without the Holy Spirit. It takes a good dose of humility to remember this when we work with others to move closer to God. Flatland Church has some very good resources to help us move including mentoring and coaching. Sometimes it is very hard to admit we need help but there is help. Of course, our mentors and coaches need a good dose of humility too, remembering that it is only by the Holy Spirit that they can be of any use.

It is somewhat of a joke in the research team but I always seem to turn to Philippians 2. Paul reminds us that it is only through humility that we can really be effective just as the only way of our salvation was through humility, through Jesus Christ’s sacrifice. When our desire is to move closer to God, we have to put aside self and give Him our all in obedience.

When we submit to God and to each other we will find the promises in [Proverbs 3:5-10][1] fulfilled in our lives. Our path in life will become clear; we will experience an abundant life. Empowered by the Holy Spirit, we can do oh so much more than what we can on our own. Humbling ourselves to God is the only way we can move to the center. Let’s move!

> _Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others._‭‭-[Philippians‬ ‭2:3-4‬ ‭NIV][2]
