Change can be incredibly hard.  The older we get, the more we become set in our ways and resist change.  Not only do we resist changes in where we live, how we live, our jobs, our daily routines...we also make excuses for who we are.  “It’s who I am...I was raised that way...You can’t teach an old dog new tricks…”.  Or, “I’m a good person…I don’t need to change.”

But God wants us to continually grow, and we cannot grow without changing.  Perhaps we are comfortable with our lives the way they are.  Perhaps we fear the unknown, perhaps the prospect of change causes anxiety, perhaps making a change requires stepping outside our comfort zone.  We don’t want to lose all that’s familiar, or to lose a part of who we are. 

> You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. -[Ephesians 4:22-24][1]

God cares more about our character than our comfort.  He did not want us to remain stagnant in our growth. He sent us the greatest gift of all for that change and growth.  Our comfort lies in our Savior; He is the constant in our lives which will remain in the midst of change.  We need not fear the unknown, for He is known.  In Him we have the power to transform.  Change is good.  Change is necessary.  But He will never change. 

> _Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever._  -[Hebrews 13:8][2]

** Questions:**
* Are your prayers for change generic or specific?  If you’re asking God to “help me be a better person…”, try putting your characters sins and weaknesses into words. 
* Do you know what you need to change?  If not, ask God for wisdom in clearly defining any deep-rooted issues you may not be aware of.
