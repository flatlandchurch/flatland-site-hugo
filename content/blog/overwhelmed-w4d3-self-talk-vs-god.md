#### [Romans 10:11-15][1]

I’m great. After all, [I’ve been formed in the image and likeness of God,][5] right? That’s as may be, but I’m really not great. Anything in me that’s good is a gift from God, which I receive from Him, yet don’t truly deserve. [Only God is good.][2] Once I cut myself off from the one and only source of good, I revert back to my good-for-nothing self. Let’s face it, DIY is the most certain way to becoming overwhelmed. And my only hope of consistently stepping aside and letting God do something good in and through me is to allow myself to hear these things on an ongoing basis.

God’s Word is a living document. By this we mean that, [since the Holy Spirit was literally present inspiring all scripture when the words went down on paper,][3] He is still literally present in the reading of them. There’s living power in the Word of God. A power we can’t access from any worldly source. And this almighty power releases us from any and all of the constraints preventing us from overcoming an overwhelming world. Reading the Bible with our eyes and meditating on it in our minds is exactly what we should be doing. Additionally, hearing the good news with our ears brings us to yet another level. There’s just something supernatural that happens to us when we listen to someone who speaks God’s Truth.

Even so, because we have sin in our lives, we will sometimes doubt and/or not understand what God is trying to say through His Word. We should remember that before sin entered the world, God knew what we didn’t know; that it’s not good for us to go it alone. Since it wasn’t good for us to be alone before sin, it’s a worse idea now that we have sin. [The good news is that God already created help for us by creating community.][4] Now it’s up to us to accept the help He’s generously providing. Getting into a [Life Group][lg] benefits all of us. It benefits you by hearing the Truth spoken and it benefits others when they hear you speak it. Even if you think you don’t know much of the Bible, God wants you to speak into the ears of others what you do know. The supernatural power we unleash to overcome an overwhelming world is best accessed in the knowing, speaking and hearing of the Word of Truth.

### Challenges
- Do you belong to a community in which the Word of Truth is freely and consistently spoken and heard?
- If not, what’s preventing you from receiving the help God knows you need?
If so, are you actively inviting others or are you keeping your group to yourself?
