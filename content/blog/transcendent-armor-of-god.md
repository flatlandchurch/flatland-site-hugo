[Mark 5:1-17][1]

The demon possessed man was a Hulk of a man. Don't get him angry! There is another Hulk of man in the Bible, Samson. The two were inhumanly strong, able to break any bond that held them. But there is a big difference between them, the one who empowered them. Samson was filled with the Spirit of the Lord ([Judges 13:25][2]) whereas the man that encountered Jesus was possessed by an evil demon. In both cases, it wasn't the man who was strong but the one who lived in them. Samson became like every other man without the Spirit ([Judges 16:20][3]).

We don't normally encounter a demonic force directly but they do exist and battle against us ([Ephesians 6:12][4]). However, like Samson, we have the Holy Spirit who will make us strong against that which opposes us. Jesus has already conquered those powers for us if we just trust in him ([Colossians 2:15][5]). We are called to put on the armor of God ([Ephesians 6:10-20][6]) that we will not be overcome but to overcome. To switch super heroes, it isn't the person in the armor that is strong but the armor that makes us Iron Man. We have the power of the Holy Spirit who has broken every chain that would bind us. He will fill us and empower us and make us conquerors. 

> _“For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,”_ [Colossians‬ ‭1:13][7]‬ ‭

**Questions**
1. What seems to always feel more powerful than you? Ask Jesus to help and give you the power to overcome. 
2. What steps can you take to put on the [armor of God][8]? 
3. If you haven't, ask Christ save you and to fill you with His Holy Spirit.  [Acts 2:38-39][9]
