[**Acts 17:16ff**][acts17]

Did you know that in nature, God presents us with many life application lessons that we can learn from? I know it may sound odd, but the Giant Timber Bamboo gives us some very solid insight that we can and should learn from. Giant Timber Bamboo farmers begin with a small seed, plant it, and water it regularly for an entire year, but nothing happens. The second year these farmers water it again, nothing happens. The third year they water it, and still there is result to be seen for their effort. How infuriating! But, if they remain consistent and continue to water it into the fourth year, the tree finally sprouts and grows up to ninety feet in six weeks!

The process of sharing the Good News and leading others to Jesus has many parallels with the Giant Timber Bamboo tree. There are times where we can become discouraged when all of our efforts with a person appear to be fruitless. When this happens, keep in mind that just like with the bamboo, where for 3+ years over 100-yards of roots are growing below the surface, there is work being done in an unbeliever that we cannot see ([John 16:8][jhn168]). There are also times when we talk to someone who we believe might take some time to come to Christ, but during the conversation a switch is flipped within that person and that person comes to Jesus right then and there. We just never know how much work has been going on beneath the surface, and even though there may be no external evidence of growth, remember that people may be much closer to salvation than we think.

This is why we are called to be ready at all times to give an answer for the hope we possess ([1 Peter 3:15][1pe315]). Sometimes we will be called to be the initial planter of the Word, and that means we might not see the outcome. Other times we will get the incredible opportunity to let the Holy Spirit work through us as the final catalyst in bringing a person to Christ. No matter the outcome, always remember that Godâ€™s word never returns void. It will accomplish that which He purposes and will succeed in the thing for which He sent it ([Isaiah 55:11][isa5511]). So, with each and every opportunity that comes your way, stay faithful, stay patient, and keep watering the bamboo.

> _As the heavens are higher than the earth,_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so are my ways higher than your ways_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my thoughts than your thoughts._   
> _As the rain and the snow come down from heaven,_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not return to it_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without watering the earth_  
> _and making it bud and flourish,_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater,_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so is my word that goes out from my mouth:_  
> _It will not return to me empty,_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but will accomplish what I desire_  
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and achieve the purpose for which I sent it._ -[Isaiah 55:9-11][isa5511]
