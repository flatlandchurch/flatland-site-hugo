**[Philippians 3:1][1]**

The illustration during the sermon Sunday of the train derailment due to a bunch of small little bugs really struck me. How could a multi-ton train be derailed by something that was easily squashed under its wheels? But it wasn’t just one little bug, it was millions. And I laughed. How often do I allow a single small little life issue that is easily swatted away derail me.  Throw a whole bunch of small issues in life and it is so easy to be derailed from following God’s calling.

So what is the solution? Something else that is small, seemingly insignificant, “Whatever happens, rejoice in the Lord.”  Paul repeats himself soon after that in Philippians, “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: rejoice!”
[Philippians 4:4][2]  It sounds too easy but Paul makes this phrase one of his theme songs, for example, [1 Thessalonians 5:16-18][3]. He [speaks from personal experience][4]. He knew the debris that is thrown in our life but he also knew that [we are more than conquerors][5]. As we rejoice that God is with us and making us more than conquerors the debris is pushed aside, we won’t be derailed. Let’s move!

> _Yours, Lord, is the greatness and the power_   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_and the glory and the majesty and the splendor,_   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_for everything in heaven and earth is yours._   
> _Yours, Lord, is the kingdom;_   
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are exalted as head over all._ -[1 Chronicles 29:11][6]
