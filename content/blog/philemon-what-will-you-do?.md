As we come to the end of [Philemon][1] questions keep popping up, what did Philemon do? Did Philemon accept Onesimus back as a brother in Christ? Did he forgive him? Did he make Onesimus a free man? God left the answers out of the Bible. I wonder if God did it intentionally. God wants us to put ourselves in Philemon’s shoes and answer those same questions. Would we do as Paul asked? Will we?

Will you do as Paul asked for that person who has hurt you, offended you, stolen from you? Will you wrap your arms around that person and forgive them, as God has forgiven them? Will you free them from bondage? Will you change your relationship with them from master/slave to beloved family member? Could Paul say of you, “I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus.” [Philemon 1:4-5][2] (NIV) Its time.

> _This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth._ -[1 John 3:16,18][3]

> _Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: **In this world we are like Jesus.**_ -[1 John 4:7,16-17][4]
