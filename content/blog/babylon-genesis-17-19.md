[**Genesis 17-19**][1]

Today, we see that Abraham has already been given God’s word that Sarah would bear him a son. Now He sends three spiritual messengers, clothed in flesh so they may be visible to Abraham, to confirm His promise. Overhearing the conversation between her husband and the visitors, Sarah, barren her entire life and now long past child-bearing years, laughs in disbelief. When confronted by the angels for this, Sarah lies. Nevertheless, Sarah’s blessing remains intact. Note that God’s promises are true regardless of human skepticism.

During this same visit of blessing, God reveals to righteous Abraham His plan of judgement against unrighteousness. He’s going to destroy a “type” of Babylon. Notice the dialogue that follows and ask yourself if you would speak to the Lord as Abraham did. Even so, the Lord reaches an agreement with Abraham to spare the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah if ten righteous people can be found in them. Imagine people so committed to rebellion against God that not even ten people could be found righteous in two cities combined.

As soon as Lot’s family of four are rescued, destruction of the cities is immediate. Since we see swift judgement from God in this case, why do you think God’s judgement against the unrighteous is often delayed in our world today? Why does God allow bad things to keep happening? The answer can be found, apparently ironically, in God’s mercy. When we engage in rebellious behavior against God, our love of self supersedes our love of God; we typify Babylon. While actively rejecting any authority higher than ourselves, God’s loving mercy is shown in His patience with us, giving us every opportunity to turn from our idolatrous ways of making ourselves our god to lovingly embracing Him as our God.
