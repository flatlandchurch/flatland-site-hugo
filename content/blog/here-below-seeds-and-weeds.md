**[The Parable of the Sower][1]**

> _Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful._ -[Mark 4:18-19 (NIV)][2]

How often do we find ourselves waking up in the morning after hitting the snooze button 3 times on the alarm, rushing to get ready for work, choking down something to eat, if at all, spend a long busy day at the ol' grindstone, coming home and crashing. Before we realize it, another week has gone by, another month, another year. And what have we accomplished?

Life comes at us very fast and very hard. Things happen. But before you hit that snooze button the very first time, stop, get up and spend time with God. Before you choose to crash in front of the TV and let your mind be sapped, let it be refreshed by the Word of God as you read it. Before you decide to cram down a tasteless fast food meal, choose to fast and pray that God may feed you.

We have a choice; we can let life sweep us away with doing stuff and become weary and burdened down by the weeds of life. Or we can come to Christ and find rest and peace. We may end up doing more than ever before but we won't find it burdensome for there are no weeds in Christ.

> _Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light._ -[Matthew 11:28-30 (NIV)][3]
