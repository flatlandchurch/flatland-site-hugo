**[Joshua 1-5]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua1-5)**

Joshua was a great military leader. He was a great executive leader. Most important, he was a great spiritual leader. The people of Israel were not an easy people to lead which is why Joshua's accomplishments were amazing. It is probably why God when commissioning Joshua said to him three times "Be strong and courageous." God knew His people. 

It is very clear that it was Joshua's strength and courage but most importantly his devotion and obedience to God that kept the people together. [Judges 2]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges2:10-12) says that when the people's memory of Joshua faded they also forgot the Lord. They quickly started following other god's that were common in the Promised Land because the failed to drive out all the people with their false gods despite Joshua's final words to them ([Joshua 24]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua24)). Without a strong leader, the people will abandon the way of God. 

Our leader is Jesus Christ. When we follow Him we will be victorious. But Jesus gave us leaders in the church as well to help us in our walk with Christ. [Ephesians 4:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians 4:11) We need to follow the leaders of our church. We need to help strengthen and encourage them. The calling upon their lives is not an easy one especially when we get stubborn like the Israelites did with Moses. If we follow our godly church leaders like the people followed Joshua we will be victorious. 

**Ask Yourself**
1. How might I strengthen and encourage our pastors?
2. What victories can we accomplish if we work together with our church leaders?
3. Where is Jesus leading me today?
