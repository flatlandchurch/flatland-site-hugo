You won’t get to take anything with us when we go to be with Jesus.  It will be just you in the coffin or urn, and you won’t see a U-Haul behind the hearse.  But you need not go empty-handed, if you _store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal._  [(Matthew 6:20)][1]

What does Jesus mean by this?  How do we store treasures in heaven?  And how are we supposed to part with the possessions we worked so hard for on earth?

How are you treating your possessions and people? Do you use possessions and love people, or do you love possessions and use people?  Do you treat people with forgiveness and loyalty, or do you store up hatred in your heart?  Do you use your money for your own purposes and pleasure, or do you give to those less fortunate?  Do you chase after security based on success and money, or embrace security by chasing after Jesus?  Do you spend your time worrying about life, or have you given your life to Jesus?

You are storing up treasures on earth if the object of your affection is centered on yourself and what you can accumulate. If your greatest treasure is Jesus, you will desire to put your time, money, resources and talent into pursuits that glorify Him and you will store up treasures in the kingdom of heaven.

> _In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life._ [(1 Timothy 6: 19)][2]
