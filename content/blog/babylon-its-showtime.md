[**Revelation 19-22**][1]

This year we have been called into discipleship. We are to be disciples of Christ which in part entails being disciple makers. We are called to be Christ-like, lead other to Christ that they may believe, and then walk with them, building them up in the faith. We have also seen there are many pitfalls along the way. We need the Holy Spirit to be able to walk the walk and talk the talk. But Babylon is right there, calling us to what appears to be a very attractive life. Babylon is however a house on fire with people inside. We can be foolish and try to fix the house as it burns down around us. But as the old saying goes, you can’t fix stupid.

Just as a fireman puts on his protective gear to run into that house to help rescue those trapped inside, we are to put on our protective gear. Paul said, “Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” [Ephesians 6:10-20][2] Talk about a house on fire.

We have had a lot of training to prepare us to run into that fire with all our protective gear. Like actors preparing for a play, we have learned our lines. We have established our marks. We have practiced. We have put on the appropriate dress. Let us not get distracted by Babylon's call but recognize it for the dumpster fire it is. We are ready for opening night. Time to put everything into practice. It's showtime!

> _Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 25But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.__ -James 1:22-25
