[**James 1:1-4**][james]

When I did some research on what grit means I discovered it almost always is accompanied by the word true as in true grit which implies that some people may display grit _but it is false_. [One definition I read][grit] said, “To have grit means you have courage and show the strength of your character.” A person with false grit I suppose is one who prances about acting all John Wayne but the second any sort of problem comes their way, they quickly show that they have no courage, that the character they display is a false facade which hides decay.

James wrote to the Christian Jews of the “Diaspora” (see also [Acts 6:1,][acts6] [John 7:35,][john] and [1 Peter 1:1][1pe]), probably early in the life of the Church. James refers to a church metting with the term synagogue which would indicate a very early writing, [2:2][james22]). James was most likely written before the council of Jerusalem which we find in [Acts 15][acts15]. There was [tension among Jewish believers][acts6]and possible tension between Christian Jews and Christian Gentiles. Christian Jews [faced persecution][acts14] from traditional Jewish groups as well, [Paul before his conversion][acts9] is an example. James wrote to Jewish Christians facing serious “trials of many kinds.”

The crazy part, James tells them to consider it pure joy that they are going through the trials. Why!?! Because the trials will result in them having true grit. I found his exhortation slightly circular. He wants us to have enough grit to endure the trials. Our trials produce perseverance, aka, grit. Through perseverance our grit becomes mature, true grit. Those with false grit will fall away because of the persecution.Those who embrace the trial, considering it pure joy, will become even grittier. As such, let us embrace the tests and trials thrown at us because we know that on the other end, we will be victorious.

> _In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ._ -[1 Peter 1:6-7][1pe16]
