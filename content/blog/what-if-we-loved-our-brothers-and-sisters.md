	[1 John 2][1jn2]

John continues his moral test of salvation in the commandment to love one another.   It is an old commandment, the second greatest commandment, and yet a new commandment and a way of life.  Second only to loving God, we are commanded to love one another.  John reminds us that we have heard this from the beginning.  _For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another._ [1 John 3:11][1jn311]

In the beginning, we are reminded, _was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God._ ([John 1:1][jhn11]).  _Love your neighbor as yourself_ was among the ten commandments given to Moses ([Mark 12:31][mrk1231]).  So what makes this a new commandment, a new way of life?  

John, often referred to as “the disciple whom Jesus loved”, was present during Jesus’s early ministry and miracles, a witness to the glory of Christ, present at the crucifixion, walked with Jesus after the resurrection, received the Holy Spirit, and watched our Lord ascend with the promise to return.  John wants this relationship for everyone, to experience the unconditional and sacrificial love of Jesus. **Love for one another is evidence of a close relationship with Christ.**

> _Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble._ -[1 John 2:10][1jn210]
