**[Colossians 3:1-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians3:1-16)**

Paul instructs the Colossians in qualities they should possess as Christians…  
 
_Compassion_: the capacity to feel sorrow for anotherʼs suffering or misfortune; responding to God and others with love and concern rather than selfishness.
 
_Kindness_:   concern for the well-being of others; moral goodness or integrity in the way we treat others, even those who are challenging or offensive.
 
_Humility_:  the absence of any feelings of being better than others; admitting that we are in need of a Savior; recognizing God’s supremacy in our lives and how limited we are in comparison.
 
_Gentleness_:  the quality of being kind, tender, or mild-mannered; control of our strength and power, rather than abuse of it.
 
_Patience_:  the capacity to endure what is difficult or disagreeable without complaining; the ability to wait on God’s perfect timing even when our personal agenda seems to be failing.
 
_Bearing with one another_:  tolerance of other believers’ differences.
 
_Forgiveness_:  release from the guilt or penalty of an offense; lack of vengeance; cancelling a debt in an act of mercy and grace.
 
_Love_:  a feeling of strong or constant regard for and dedication to someone; harmony, the positive combination of things which are not exactly the same.
 
These traits closely reflect the fruits of the spirit listed in Galatians. _But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,  gentleness and self-control.  Against such things there is no law._
[Galatians 5: 22]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians5:22)
 
Fruit is the natural product of a living thing.  The fruits of the spirit are the characteristics of Christ manifested in our lives.  Just as physical fruit needs to grow, the fruits of the spirit grow when we weed out our old sinful desires.  They take shape and ripen when we give the Holy Spirit more control over our lives.  
 
**Questions:**
1. Which fruits in you are ripe?   
2. Which fruits need weeding and shaping?
3. With whom do you need to be more compassionate, kind, gentle, forgiving, and patient?
