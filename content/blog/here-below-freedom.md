How would you define freedom?  Most people would define freedom as being in a state of serving no one.  But, as Christians, we know that’s impossible.  Suppose one of the Huskers decided he was going to “break free; serving no one”, not even the coach.  In this case it’s easy to see that he would be serving the other team.  And very effectively!

In the parable of the Prodigal Son we see a boy chasing after that ever-elusive state of being free.  In this case, he’s going to attempt that feat with money.  His plan is to buy freedom.  Note that immediately he becomes a servant of every desire that his sinful nature demands.  And, when his buying “power” runs out, he finds himself deep in the filth of pig slop.

He begins to come to his senses when he realizes that his father’s servants are living a better life than he is.  He sees that serving his father isn’t so bad after all.  And, he takes deliberate steps back to serving his father.  He now realizes that failing to serve his father is making him a servant of destruction.

When we’re idle for the Lord, we’re serving the other team – Satan. And very effectively!  We eventually find ourselves living in pig slop, as opposed to living in rich blessings which our Father lavishly provides and wants for His children. So let us set our hearts on the Father and find our place of service for the Lord.

> _Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. **You have been set free** from sin and have become slaves to righteousness._ -[Romans 6:16-18 (NIV)][1]
