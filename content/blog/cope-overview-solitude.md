[**John 14-16][john14]

God asks us to walk through storms we sometimes do not understand, though he knows the purpose.  Jesus, like any other human, was called to walk through storms, the only difference being that he knew the purpose.  Yet still he needed to cope, and he modeled the coping mechanism of solitude.

* Jesus prayed all night on a mountain prior to choosing his disciples ([Luke 6:12][luke6]).  Likely asking for discernment, this time away from distractions, in deep meditation with the Lord, prepared him for the first important decision in his ministry.

* Upon returning from a ministry tour, finding a crowd of people, Jesus directed himself and the disciples to a quiet place to rest ([Mark 6:30-31][mark6]). Even the son of God needed time away from the rush to be with God and rekindle his passions, energy, and focus.

* After hearing about the death of John the Baptist, Jesus withdrew in a boat to a desolate place ([Matthew 14:13][mat14]).  John was a precious soul to Jesus, his kin, a brother in the work.  He grieved as anyone would when dealing with a loss, and needed time alone with his Father.

* Hours before his arrest, [Jesus withdrew with his disciples][mat26] to the Mount of Olives, then retreated from his companions to pray.  At the most trying time of his life he sought alone, to plead in earnest but also to accept the will of the Father.

Jesus experienced all the worry, anxiety, sadness, and pain of any human.  Solitude was one of many ways he coped.  Itâ€™s important to note that in solitude we are not truly alone.  Jesus sought solitude to be alone with his Father, and now He is with us in our solitude.


> *But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.* ~Matthew 6:6
