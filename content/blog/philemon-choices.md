In the story of Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket is assigned the role of the wooden boy’s conscience. In the words of the Blue Fairy:

> _I dub you Pinocchio's conscience, Lord High Keeper of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong, Counselor in Moments of High Temptation, and Guide Along the Straight and Narrow Path. Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket._

It could be easy and fun to have a cute cartoon character beside us for life, telling us what to say, how to act, what to do and not to do, narrating our lives as Jiminy narrates the movie. 

In reality we have several voices narrating our lives...our parents, friends, the media, music, government...and God.  Our lives are more complicated than Pinocchio’s.  We need to decide which voices to listen to.  

Who is your “Lord High Keeper of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong, Counselor in Moments of High Temptation, and Guide Along the Straight and Narrow Path”?  Jiminy sings and dances, whistles, and wishes upon a star.  God has done so much more.  He sent his son, then his Holy Spirit, to be our guide, and He calls upon us to pray instead of wish.  If you’re listening to a cricket, capture him and set him free outside where he belongs, and call upon God.  _Arise, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit._

> _Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect._  -[Romans 12:2][1]

**Task:**  Make a list of everyone and everything that influences your choices.  Then put them in order according to which you listen to the most.  If there are any crickets, make a plan to eliminate them.  If God is not at the top of your list, make a plan to place Him there.
