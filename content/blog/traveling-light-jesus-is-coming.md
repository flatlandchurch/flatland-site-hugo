### Traveling Light [Luke 10:1-24][1]
Luke records Jesus’ directive to “travel light”.  He tells them not to take money or suitcase or even a change of sandals.  Like taking a journey by motorcycle, we keep it simple, taking only what we need and leave our entire stuff-filled house behind. And we have more joy in that adventure than we could possibly experience sitting at home surrounded by our stuff.

In keeping the journey simple and joyful, the 72 are given a simple message; Jesus is coming (vv1, 9 & 11).  The 72 go ahead and meet complete strangers with the specific and simple purpose of introducing them to Jesus.  “So”, they might ask, “who is Jesus?”  Jesus is the one responsible for the healing of the sick (in context – those with terminal illness) up to and including casting out demons.  Because of these signs, they become very eager to meet this Jesus.

Jesus sends them out, as He sends us out today with almost nothing – compared with the world.  We’re like meager lambs compared to strong wolves.  However, Jesus gives us authority over them.  Jesus says we will encounter sicknesses of many kinds.  Jesus gives us authority over sickness.  Jesus assures us that there will be those who listen to us.  He also assures us there will be those who don’t listen to us.  We have it on our Father in Heaven’s authority that those who listen to us in the Name of Jesus listen to Him.  Those who reject us when we tell them about what Jesus means to us reject God, Himself.  Don’t worry/have nothing to do with them (v11), just keep spreading the Word: “Jesus is coming”.

### Questions
1. If the governor of your state handed you a pardon to deliver to someone on death row, would you hesitate or go straight away to deliver that pardon?  What do you see as potential consequences of stuffing that pardon in your pocket and leaving it there?
2. Read [Romans 10:14][2]. How do these questions make our very purpose in this life simple, clear and crucial?  How will you deliver Jesus’ “pardon” to people before another on death row dies?
