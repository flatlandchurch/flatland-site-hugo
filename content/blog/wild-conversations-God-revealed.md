[**Acts 17:16ff**][acts17]

Pastor Bart Sunday said something that stuck with me, “God can reveal himself even in false religions.” It reflected what Paul says in [Romans][rom1], "For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made." Paul goes on to say that despite having the knowledge of the true God, people make up other gods and worship them. But even then, people are made in God's image and cannot escape God's revelation of Himself even in what they make. God is there.

We often feel like we don't have a way to even start our wild conversations. Paul in his adventures shows us that no matter where we go and with whom we might converse, there is something there that can open up a dialog. It is right there, we have something in common with that other person or persons. God is clearly seen in it. We just have to start with the plain in sight and move them to see God. We point, God draws, and the people will accept or reject. Its not like they are blind to God, they see. God is there.

One of the things we learn from Paul is to keep our eyes open, look around and see God in everything. We need to find those points we have in common with others so that we can then point to God. It is interesting that Paul was distressed when he saw all the idols in Athens but _he didn't allow that distress from keeping him from speaking_ to those people who raised the idols. Rather, he started there and moved them in the direction of God. When we start looking around, we will become distressed over the evil in the world but we can not allow it to keep us from the people that need God.  God will reveal Himself through those things that distress us if we but remember **they need God**. We point, God draws, and the people will accept or reject. For God is there.

> _Shout for joy to God, all the earth;  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sing the glory of his name;  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give to him glorious praise!  
> Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.”  
> All the earth worships you  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sings praises to you;  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they sing praises to your name._ -Psalm 66:1-4
