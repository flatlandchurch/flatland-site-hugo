#### [Psalm 37][ps37]

Trusting God is fundamental to following Christ--to move closer to Him who saves. But there are some of us who live with a carefree attitude. We make no plans, we don’t want any plans. We want to do whatever seems right at the momement and let life just sweep us along without a care. It reminds me of a character in a very old TV show who was a beatnik/proto-hippie, name of Maynard G. Krebs. He was a free spirit type person with a very funny quirk. Whenever someone said the word “work”, Maynard would shriek in horror, “Work?!?” and sometimes faint.

When we trust God, we don’t avoid from His plans for our lives. We don’t pull a maynard, shriek in fear and run away from God’s plans for our lives. We don’t avoid God’s call on our lives. We seek Him out, listen for His guidance, and follow Him, even to the cross. It isn’t a sterotypical carefree attitude, but ironically, when we follow Him with care, He gives us a “carefree” life (see [Matthew 6:25-34][mat6]).

I feel strongly an important step in hearing God’s will for our lives is to read His Word. When coupled with prayer and meditation, we indicate to God a willingness to listen. His Holy Spirit will move in our hearts and minds, leading and guiding us. It may move us more up the scale of having plans but they will be God’s plans which we know will [not be burdensome][mat11], but will allow us to be carefree because we will know God has all things in control when we follow Him.

### Challenge
- Ask yourself, am I seeking God’s will for my life?
- Ask yourself, am I willing to do God’s plan?
- Ask yourself, what am I avoiding?
