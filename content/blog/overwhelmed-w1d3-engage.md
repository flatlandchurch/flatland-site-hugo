Pastor asked, “What we can do to engage with God?” I then tried to take a bunch of notes, these are some of the things he said help us to engage with God.
* Corporate worship
    - **God is the only person in the audience, everyone else is in the choir.**
* Corporate prayer
* Corporate celebration of Communion and Water Baptism
* Small group prayer
* Small group confession
* Small group celebration
* Individual spiritual disciplines
  * pray
  * fast
  * Study
  * meditation
  * etc

Simply put, we engage with God in all aspects of our lives. [One of the books mentioned Sunday][ft] was [“The Practice of the Presence of God” by Brother Lawrence.][law] I ran across one of the most ironic statements in the book (first letter, p.19), but one that really struck me as true. “I read many books containing different methods of going to God and various practices of the spiritual life. These only served to confuse me, rather than facilitate what I sought, which was simply to become wholly God’s. So I resolved to give all for the All.” As good as the four books mentioned are, it does no good to us if we don’t first resolved “to give all for the All.” Then the books can be tools with which we can assist us in our resolve.

[Paul urges][col2] us to set our hearts and minds on God. We need to be determined fully to move to the center of God’s great love. Life can be overwhelming, crashing upon us like the storm of the century, threatening to wash everything we have and are away into the figuative sea. But as we engage with God, He will become our rock and salvation. He will see us through all the overwhelming situations that come our way. God overcomes.

### Books
- [The Practice of the Presence of God by Brother Lawrence][law]
- [Knowing God by J. I. Packer][pack]
- [Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster][fost]
- [The Life You’ve Always Wanted by John Ortberg][ort]

### Challenge
- Resolve in your heart and mind to put God first, make Him your all.
- Get one of these books and read it along side your Bible.
