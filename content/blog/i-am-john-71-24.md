[**Today's Reading: John 7:1-24 - The Teacher**][1]

Jesus has stirred up the leaders of the Jewish people, simply because of the miracles he has performed and no doubt his teachings. They were looking for him during the Festival of Tabernacles, one of the [three major festivals established by God][2] for the people. But Jesus didn't go right away, the feast lasted seven days so he waited until he could teach without interference. Sitting in the temple courtyard he taught the people and many were astounded that he could teach so well without formal schooling.

Jesus is The Teacher; he needed no formal training. Truly, the teachers in his time were wrong in many ways. They were the ones who needed to sit at the feet of Jesus to learn. He spoke the very words of the Father. Those who do the will of God will know that Jesus speaks the truth even today. They did not hear the truth. The implication is obvious.

We need to sit at Jesus’ feet, listen, learn, and let Him change us. We do so by reading his Word, praying, listening for his voice, and practicing the other spiritual disciplines. There are many spiritual disciplines depending on who is writing about them. One of the best works on the spiritual disciplines is by Richard Foster, _[Celebration of Discipline][3]._ They are often organized into two types: the disciplines of abstinence such as fasting and silence and the disciplines of engagement (with God and others) such as prayer, worship and study. We need to discipline ourselves to sit at Jesus’ feet as we do God’s will.

> _Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus._ -[1 Thessalonians 5:16-18][4]
