Charlie Winter is a devoted dad who would do anything for his kids. He'd throw himself in front a train — and even a shark. That's exactly what the North Carolina dad did Sunday, June 2nd, when his 17-year-old daughter, Paige, was attacked by a shark in Atlantic Beach at Fort Macon State Park. The heroic dad punched the shark five times to save his daughter's life.

Most everyone reading this knows that sin separates us from God. While losing a limb to a shark results in temporal circumstances, the result of separation from God is eternal.  Paige Winter will be completely restored and renewed in a glorified body for all eternity if she gives her life to Christ in this lifetime.  This is the great promise of Jesus, Himself.

Charlie Winter came between a shark and his daughter for one reason – love.  For love of his daughter he thought nothing of losing his own life.  Saving Paige weighed to heavily on his mind.  Too many times we don’t come between sin and our friends or family because we fear losing our “life”.  That life we treasure, and thus, fear losing, could be a life that includes an amicable relationship with a person.

As you reflect, how many instances of sin have you ignored in your friends or family for fear of losing your “life” with them?  What does this say about the level of love you actually have for them?
