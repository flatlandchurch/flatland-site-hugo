[**Titus 2**][1]

Titus was a Gentile, not one brought up in the faith and customs of God’s chosen Israel. Once he believed in Jesus, Paul sent him out to fulfill [the great commission][2]; to grow the church of Jesus Christ so that the world may be saved. Aware of the state of the world in their time, Paul and Titus wasted no time in making more believers in the world. Today, as we read through Titus, and the entire New Testament, we can’t help but become aware of the growth of the church, as more and more were becoming saved and fewer and fewer in the world were being left behind.

At this time, I ask you to take seriously your awareness of who you are and the condition of the world around you. As Christians, we must believe in Jesus and have a constant awareness that all that He did was to restore fellowship with His Father for humankind. You must, therefore, be aware that it’s your turn, your time, to be the agent of growth in the church so that more and more in the world may be saved and the number of lost may dwindle.

If, for example, you became aware that there was a hole in your roof, you would act with urgency to repair it knowing that if you don’t, further deterioration of the house is a certainty. As Christians we are aware of the fact that there’s a “hole” in our world. But we must not give this a mere casual look. We need to allow ourselves to accept what’s happening is a deterioration of faith. We must now be keenly aware that there’s no time to waste. As people who may or may not have been brought up from childhood in the faith, Jesus has accepted us just as we are. And He’s sending us out this very day, first and foremost to be His disciples, and secondly, to be the agents of growth in saving others by making more and more disciples. Let’s live in the awareness of the fact that Jesus wants to save the world. Let’s live today, and every day, wanting what Jesus wants.

> _Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”_ [Matthew 28:18-20 NIV][2]
