[Philippians 4:6-23][1]

“Do not be anxious about anything....” Yeah right. I am the worst worrier ever. But then again, worry works. Nothing I worry about ever happens.... Wait! What? Worrying is a waste of time? Why? Because I am a child of God. He takes care of me when I trust in Him. 

Trust in God is all about “father knows best”. Anxiety melts away when we are content with the life and circumstances that we find ourselves in because we know God will take care of us. It is when we start telling God how things should be that we become anxious. James said it this way, “You do not have because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.” [James‬ ‭4:2-3‬ ‭NIV][2] Of course we get anxious when we start telling God what to do!

When we ask God ["Your will be done"][3], everything will be taken care of. I am child of God so no! I am not a worrier. I am a warrior who will be content as Paul, no matter what the circumstances through the strength of Him who saved me.

> _“The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.”_ [James‬ ‭5:16][4]‬

### Action
Take that which you are worrying about and hand it over to the Father, asking that His will be done, and trust in Him.
