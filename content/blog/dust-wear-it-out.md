#### [Joshua 1:8][1]

How often should we read from the Bible? Well, as indicated in earlier blogs, the Bible is God’s love letter to us – it’s how we hear Him say “I love you, I care about you”. So, how often we want to hear from our closest earthly loved ones should give us a guide as to how often we should want to hear a word from our beloved Lord. With our earthly loved ones, questions come up throughout the day such as “What should we have for lunch?” and “What activity can we do today?”. Logically then, we should be just as interested – and really more – about what God wants to do while we’re together.

Are you happy? That’s a great time to hear from the Lord. Are you ill or stressed out? That’s a great time to hear from the Lord. Are you feeling unloved or short-changed in some way? That’s a great time to hear from the Lord. Do you have an important decision to make? That’s a great time to hear from the Lord. Do friends ask you for your input/advice? That’s a great time to know what the Lord has put on your heart. In short, the Word of the Lord is beneficial to us – and those around us – all day every day. It’s how we’re able to successfully get around in this otherwise dark world without stumbling and falling.

[“Your Word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path.”][2]

### Reflections
- The best time to listen to God is when you’re able to focus your attention on Him.
- What times during the day are you apt to be better focused? Will you let God have some of these times?
