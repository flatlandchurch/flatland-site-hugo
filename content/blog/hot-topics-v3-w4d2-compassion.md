#### [Psalm 103][ps]
Compassion. That word is the one which stuck in my head after hearing [Sunday's message][fl]. In all hot topics we have to have compassion but it is especially important when dealing with the hot topic of abortion. There is so much strife, anger and rejection when abortion is the topic. There has to be an over abundance of empassim to counteract the vitriol.

Compassion. God has compassion for us all. None of us are deserving of his love but out of compassion for us, [He gave his life][j316] to bring us out of death into life. We need to follow His example. No matter what side of the argument we start on, if we allow God's compassion for us flow into the discussion and we then allow it to flow out of us the vitriol often associated with the topic of abortion melts away.

Compassion. We need to have compassion for those involved in the decision of having an abortion. It isn't an easy decision for most and once taken for many it is a hard thing to live with. But when we have compassion for those involved and show them the compassion that God has for them, their lives will be changed. Children's lives will be saved and women's lives will be changed. The forgiveness God has for us covers all because He is a compassionate God.

### Challenge
- What does compassion look like? 
- What does it look like in relationship to the topic of abortion?
- How can you show compassion to those involved in the decision of abortion?
