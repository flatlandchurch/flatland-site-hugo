**[Acts 16][acts16]**

Sunday we heard from missionary Tim Shamala regarding the work God is doing in India through him. He challenged us to hear from Paul in [Romans 15][rom15] the three Ws regarding wild conversations we can have. We are to preach the **W**ord of God, we are to be **w**itnesses for God, and let the **w**onders of the Spirit speak to the people. When those three Ws are in our **w**ild conversations, people will come to the Lord, believers will be built up in Christ, and we will experience God in our own lives.

Now Paul knew what would happen when we have **w**ild conversations with those around us. People will get uncomfortable. The **W**ord of God challenges us and disrupts our comfortable lives. When we preach the **W**ord of God, **w**itnesses for God, and let the **w**onders of the Spirit speak to the people we may run into opposition. Maybe not the opposition that Paul experienced, being stripped, beat with rods, and thrown in jail, but, it can be awful. Yet it can lead to something **w**onderful.

Paul and Silas did the unexpected. Instead of whining about being thrown into jail they were singing. They had been preaching the **W**ord of God, **w**itnessing about Jesus, and performed a **w**onder of God and it certainly made the people a little more than uncomfortable. They were beaten and thrown in jail. But after singing and worshiping God, two more **wonders** of God took place. They were miraculously freed while in jail. The jailer's life had been distrupted in the most horrific way which led to Paul having to call out, "Stop, don't kill yourself!" Paul gave the man a better way, life in Christ. We then see the third and most important **wonder**, the jailer and his whole household believed in Jesus.

This is the call we all have, disrupt people's lives by proclaiming the **W**ord of God, **w**itnessing to them, and allow the Spirit to work through us that **w**onders of God may happen. Things may seem bad after distrupting others, we may find ourselves in a pickle, but God will speak through His Holy Spirit into the lives of those we disrupt and some may be like that jailer and believe. **W**onders abound when we but trust in Jesus.

> _He is the Maker of heaven and earth,

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he remains faithful forever.
> He upholds the cause of the oppressed
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gives food to the hungry.
> The Lord sets prisoners free,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord gives sight to the blind,
> the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord loves the righteous._ -Psalm 146:6-8
