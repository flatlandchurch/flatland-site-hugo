Jesus said in [Matthew 7: 13-14][1] __”Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.”__

Some people seek approval of the world in every aspect of their lives.  They are people-pleasers, conforming to what is deemed acceptable to society.  They are on the broad path  that leads to destruction.

Others seek approval of the world sometimes.  They want God’s approval, but their weaknesses cause them to sin in areas of their life where they desire the acceptance of others.  They are in danger of entering by the wide gate.

God’s ways are opposite of the world’s ways, so if we want to follow Jesus we have to draw a line in the sand and seek only God’s approval. If we don’t draw this line we will be in conflict with obeying God when the world is telling us to do something else. It is those who choose clearly and completely to seek God’s approval over that of the world who will enter through the narrow gate.

> _For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” says the Lord.  “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts.__  ~[Isaiah 55:8-9][2]
