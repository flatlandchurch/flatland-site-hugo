#### [Ephesians 6:10-18][1]
 
In Israel’s time there was one education, one God, one truth, one law. It was assumed that If God declared something, that it was absolutely true and good. God’s word was the first and final word in every situation including social, religious, health & hygiene, political and financial. Today, in the United States there are many beliefs and we allow for that. However, one problem occurs when “Christians” try to bring “Israel” over to the here and now. In many cases, we’re intolerant. And not just intolerant of immoral practices, we’re intolerant of the people who don’t adopt our morals, whether we’re perfectly abiding by them ourselves or not. And the world sees that.

What we all share in common is a concern about the fact that our kids are in their formative years. What they come to hold as true in these years will most likely be what they hold as true for their lifetime. We know full well that kids are being inundated for approximately 6 hours a day in the school system. A possible problem occurs in our homes when Christian parents aren’t prepared to compare false teaching with God’s truth and/or do not schedule sufficient time with our kids to balance one against the other.

Thinking that we can move teachers to teach only from a biblical/godly perspective is faulty thinking. We simply can’t “bring Israel over here”. Demanding that the unsaved behave like they’re saved is working the problem backward. [Loving our neighbors is what Jesus commands us to do;][2] love is Jesus’ only enticement into salvation. Meanwhile, as we love our neighbors as ourselves, we can [send our children out into the world with the full armor of God][3] so that they are not subject to spiritual defeat – no matter what influences they encounter.

### Challenges
- Are we spending any time at all teaching kids to believe biblically?
- Do we even know how to educate children in biblical truth so that they can spot a counterfeit when they see it?
- Get into a life group – a community of fellow believers – and get help in these areas, or provide help if you have some of the answers.
