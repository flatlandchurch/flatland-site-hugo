The word church is so often associated with a building, or a particular religious service or something nebulous out there that you go to. "Time to go to church" is a phrase often spoke. Some even dispute that Jesus said the word recorded in [Matthew 18][1] because there were no churches at that point. But it misses what "church" is.

Another translation of the Greek word for church would be assembly. It refers to a time when [two or more are gathered in His name][1]. So life groups could also be called life churches or life assemblies. Church doesn't refer to a place or event. It refers to people, it refers to you!

Paul teaching the Corinthians about what "church" is all about, gave the analogy of the body saying, "there are many parts, but one body.... Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it." ([1 Corinthians 12:20, 27][2]) Our spiritual call is to be active, participating, using our gifts, remembering the most excellent way, [love][3] as the reason for all of this. There is no church with out you.

**Reflection:** Have you been neglecting your spiritual gifts, hiding in the back of the auditorium hoping no one asks you to serve? Isn't it about time?

> _'Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of Godâ€™s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.'_ -[1 Peter 4:10-11][4]
