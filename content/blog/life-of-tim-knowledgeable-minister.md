Paul called upon Timothy to be, among other things, a minister. Timothy did not go to seminary nor become ordained.  The word minister has its origins in Latin meaning “servant”.  Paul wanted Timothy to be prepared to _preach the word, in season and out of season_.  Preaching is convenient, or _in season_, during scheduled times and friendly circumstances.  But we must be ready to share the word during inconvenient times as well, _out of season_, when proclaiming the truth is awkward, difficult, or resisted.

Paul also directed Timothy to _correct_ those who are in error and to _rebuke_, or speak out against wrong. He warns Timothy that people will turn away from faithful preaching, preferring instead to listen to messages that conform to their desires and make them feel good about themselves.  We must have the compassion and courage to speak the truth, even when doing so is difficult.

Timothy was further instructed to _encourage_.  Whether the seeker who needs urging, the believer who is doubting, the hurt, lonely or despaired…all are in need of support, comfort, and aid which is delivered through faith in Christ.

Finally, Timothy is told to preach _with great patience and careful instruction_. When faced with opposition, our patience will exemplify our faith and we all become teachers, instructing with both emotion and intellect as we guide believers to follow God’s truth.

>_Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction_ [(2 Timothy 4:2)][1].
