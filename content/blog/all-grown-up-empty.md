[**Ephesians 4:8-10**][1]

Is the glass half empty or half full?  What started as a psychological test to determine one’s pessimistic vs optimistic view of life, has turned into a popular cliché.  Of course the preferred view of life is optimism, and so confident people walk around saying, “My glass is always half full.”

Let’s look at this illustration from God’s view of life.  If your glass is half full, that is full of your own “stuff”, only half remains to be filled with the Spirit.  Some of us have a full glass, and there is no room for Jesus.  God wants us to empty the glass, spill everything out, wipe it up, dry it out...make room for Jesus. 

What is your glass filled with?  
* Your love for material possessions?
* Your need to fulfilled by another person?
* Your impressions of other people?
* Your guilt about your past?
* Your worries about today or tomorrow?
* Your ideas about who and what you should be?
* The notion that this life is yours?

All of this stuff clutters up our lives, pushing away Jesus.  Each thing that we love, each thing we think we need, each thing that we worry about, each idea we have of what this life should be...give each thing to Jesus, then invite him into the space you’ve created.  

> _For you were buried with Christ when you were baptized. And with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of God, who raised Christ from the dead._ -Colossians 2:12
