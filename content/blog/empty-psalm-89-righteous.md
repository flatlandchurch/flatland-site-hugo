[Proverbs 21:21][1] tells us that the Lord is pleased with _whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor_. But let’s assure that we are pursuing a righteousness that is acceptable to Him, the perfect righteousness that comes only through faith in Jesus.

Have those close to you noticed a change in you since you were saved?  The profound truth is that God did not change you; he put an end to you.  _Our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin_ [(Romans 6:6)][2].  You then began a new life with the resurrection of Christ, and with that new life came righteousness through him.  It is a gift that we cannot earn, but only graciously accept.

_We carry in our hearts the insults of so many people_ [(Psalm 89: 50)][3].  We can choose the path of self-righteousness, where we condemn the sinner who hurt us and seek justice.  Or we can grab hold of God’s righteousness, release the pain, and experience the fullness of his love.

>_Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Unfailing love and truth walk before you as attendants. Happy are those who hear the joyful call to worship, for they will walk in the light of your presence, Lord. They rejoice all day long in your wonderful reputation. They exult in your righteousness_ [(Psalm 89: 14-16)][4].
