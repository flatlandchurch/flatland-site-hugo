[**1 John 2**][1]

Jesus took the old law which, by the way, we had made extremely complicated, and simplified it for us into just two commandments. [_Love God above all else and love your neighbor as you love yourself_][2]. He then strictly warns us not to complicate these but remain in obedience to them. He says [_“If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love”._][3] John now reminds us, as strictly as Jesus did, not to break these commands. In [1 John 2:4][6], John affirms _Whoever says, “I know Him,” but does not do what He commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person._

Today, as then, we’re faced with the test which comes from living in the world. The world is still bombarding us daily with idols of many sorts and tries to assure us that these should be everyone’s pursuit. Marketers craftily make any product appear as an urgent need in our life – from cars to clothes to sex to political “correctness” – if we don’t have what the world is advocating, we’re “less than complete”. What we’re faced with is the test of our obedience: Do we love God above all else, or do we have Him tucked away in the back of our minds, bringing Him to thought only when we have need?  Are we just liars as John indicates?

God loved us first – [unconditional and never failing is His love for us.][4]  As Jesus was living in the world, His love for us was tested through the most excruciating measures. And, through every test, His love for us was proven in His obedience to the Father. In light of the facts, how much more should we submit to the Lord in our every move?

> _Whoever claims to live in Him must live as Jesus did._ -[1 John 2:6][5]
