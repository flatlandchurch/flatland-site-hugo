### [Philippians 1][1]

Humility is the opposite of arrogance and selfishness; it is the quality of having a modest opinion or estimate of one's own importance.

We all know arrogant and selfish people.  They think the world revolves around them, everyone should look out for their needs, they are unable to empathize with others.  They act like they are “the king of the world” and deserve to be treated as such.

If anyone had cause to act in this manner, it was Christ.  He is the king of the earth and heavens.  Yet God sent him to the world in the humblest of manners, to be born of a woman of low social status. His first bed was a feeding trough.  He grew up in the small, secluded agricultural village of Nazareth.  He worked as a carpenter.  He was kind to a tax collector, a prostitute, and a leper. He was not too busy or too important to give his attention to children.  His disciples, after walking the dirt trails in sandals, had their feet washed by this man they called Lord.

Selfish people are ultimately cowards.  As full of confidence as they present themselves to be, when push comes to shove, they will take the easy way out.  When the time came for Jesus to be captured and tried, he could have run, he could have hid, he could have lied.  But he humbly succumbed to God’s plan, knowing the pain and suffering he would endure.  And while the arrogant crowd mocked our King, he forgave them and humbly took their punishment.

> _In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:  Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage._  [Philippians 2:5-6][1]

### Questions:
1. Have you ever lied to get out of something (say a traffic ticket, or cheating)?  What would Jesus do?
2. If you are living a luxurious, or even comfortable, lifestyle, how can you stay humble?  What would Jesus do?
