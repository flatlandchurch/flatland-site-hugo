[**Phillippians 3:1**][1]

Coincidentally, just before this week’s sermon, I was reading about Abraham and how he was given the mission of [killing his son][2], Isaac. Abraham could have been petrified. He could have prayed for God to get him out of this trial. He could even have prayed that Isaac would die by some other means so Abraham could at least be personally separated from this horrific task. Instead, Abraham actually got up early the next morning, just to get started in his obedience to God. Abraham set out without hesitation in God’s promise that He would always be with Abraham. Abraham’s laser-focused faith in God is what saved him, his son, and generations to come. Abraham delighted and rejoiced in the Lord – come what may.

_If I say, “My foot slips,” Your mercy, O Lord will hold me up. In the multitude of my anxieties within me, your comfort delights my soul._ (Ps 94:18-19) How much rejoicing we do in the midst of the most severe trials chiefly depends on faith. In other words, if I really believe that Jesus will never leave me or forsake me, I rejoice in that truth.  I’m not saying we should be glad we’re in pain and pray that God piles more on. But I am saying that God is here, working a great thing in and through our trials. And having God literally with and in us is cause for rejoicing in any circumstances.

What comes between you and faith in God that causes you to get derailed? What “worldly junk” or “debris” has, or may prevent you from rejoicing in God’s presence and promises? Train rides can be dark, shaky, loud and even slow-going. But through it all, we know the engineers are present with us fulfilling their promise of safely reaching our destination. So, with infinitely more confidence, we know the Holy Spirit will complete His job in bringing us ever closer to our Father through faith in Jesus Christ. And every cow on the tracks, every curve, every rattle, every scary dark tunnel, every delay or even stop, is simply part of the process in which He’s present with us, in us, and guiding us through.

> _In the multitude of my anxieties within me, your comfort delights my soul._ Ps 94:19 NKJV
