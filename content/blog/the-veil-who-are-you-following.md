### [Hebrews 4:14][1]

In the beginning was Jesus and He was with God our Father.  Through Jesus, all creation came into being.  Our very existence on this earth came by Way of Jesus ([John 1:1-5][2]), and our relationship with God was good and holy ([Genesis 1:31][3]).  But sin caused our separation from the eternal holiness of God.  While most of us know these verses by heart, we somehow let something just as well-known slip from our thinking.  The surest way to return to where you started is to turn around and retrace your steps.  In other words, if we follow the same route, we will certainly end up where we started.

“I Am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me” ([John 14:6][4]).  Our loving Father brings us all full circle when He shows us that the same person who brought us forth from Him will return us to Him.  We are absolutely certain of our right relationship being restored with God through Jesus and only through Jesus.  No other way is possible, and religion misses the mark.  Even a child can understand that if you want to get somewhere, you have to follow the one who’s been there.

### Questions
1. Have you ever entertained the notion that all faiths/religions are basically the same?  How many have a prophet who has actually been where he’s telling you he can lead you?
