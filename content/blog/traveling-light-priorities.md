[Luke 11:37-54][1]

Jesus constantly surprised those around him. He had a completely different vision of what was important and necessary. He brought Martha up short on what he thought was important and he completely shuts down the self-righteous Pharasees and Bible experts with a standard that they just didn't see coming. They thought they were doing everything that God demanded of them but they fell well short.

They and we in turn can not measure up to the _God standard_ and we have to acknowledge that. We have to shift our perspective. We have to submit to the whole concept that only Christ can meet the standard, only Christ did. In doing so he opened a way for us to obtain the unobtainable, eternal life.

Jesus doesn't excuse us from being righteous (v42). But he changes the perspective of what that means. It is all about the heart, to whom do we belong. Faith in Him and the fruit that we bear from that belief is what he seeks, not a bunch of check marks next to a list of do and don'ts.  Woe to us if our perspective is on what we do. We triumph when our sight is on what he did.

> _Show me your ways, Lord,_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_teach me your paths._
> _Guide me in your truth and teach me,_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_for you are God my Savior,_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_and my hope is in you all day long._ [Psalm 25:4-5][2]

### Action
Examine what you have prioritized as most important. Are they Christ?
