### [Colossians 3:1-4][1]

It seems now that how we identify ourselves, even when not true, is more important than who we really are. There are many who call themselves Christian but who have never actually become a child of God through faith in Jesus. Some may want to identify as Christian but [are just fooling themselves][2].  We have to _be_ what we call ourselves in truth and action. 

Paul says we need to set our hearts and minds on things above, “[not on earthly things][3].” It is a completely different attitude from what false Christians as well as anti-Christians would believe, feel, and do. Identifying with Christ means having a completely different lifestyle, completely different goals and desires. 

As citizens of God’s kingdom we also have a responsibility. We are called, no, make that commanded to go into the world and proclaim the good news that the [kingdom is here][4].  (s.a. [Acts 1:8][5]) Our lives must glow out “I identify with Christ” without needing to say a word but it is through [proclamation that the lost may be saved][6].  So, lets get to it.
