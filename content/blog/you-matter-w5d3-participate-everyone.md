#### [1 Peter 4:7-11][1pe]
I have heard it said, “90% of ministry in a church is done by 10% of the people.” I would love to type it in all caps, shouting at the top of my lung, "**No!** Everyone, _yes_, everyone needs to participate in the ministry." Simply put, Jesus, Paul, Peter, John... the writers of the New Testament... _God_ makes it very clear, we are _all_ called to be active participants in the ministries of the Body of Christ. No excuses.

Our calling is to participate with the gifts God has given us. Paul says in [Romans 12][rom12], "so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to _all_ the others." He goes on to describe some of the gifts God gives including some that a few would not even characterize as God's gifts but Paul makes it very clear they are, including service, encouragement and mercy.

The gift(s) God gives you do not belong to you, rather, you and your gift(s) belong to everyone else in the Body. We are to use our gifts, not out of duty but out of love. Paul continues in [Romans 12:10][rom12], "Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves." Love for one another should drive us to actively participate in the Body. Instead of 10% of the Body doing 90% of the ministry, 100% of us should be active in ministry.

### Challenge
If you are not actively participating in the ministry of the church, take a look at Flatland's ministries pages on the [website][fl]. Give prayerful thought about signing up for ministry on the [Flatland Volunteer page][flv].

> _The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear-minded and sober, so that you can pray. Above all, love one another deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without complaining. As good stewards of the manifold grace of God, each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve one another. If anyone speaks, he should speak as one conveying the words of God. If anyone serves, he should serve with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen._ -1 Peter 4:7-11
