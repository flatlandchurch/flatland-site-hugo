After telling the [Parable of the Good Samaritan][1], Jesus asks, “Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?” ([v36][1]).  The lawyer answered, “The one who showed him mercy.” ([v37][1]).  He was referring, of course, to the Samaritan who bandaged the man’s wounds, took him to an inn and took care of him, then paid the innkeeper to continue his care.  

So what about the innkeeper?  He’s behind the scenes and gets no recognition in the story.  His job was to provide room and board, yet he agreed to take on the care of a stranger.  Perhaps he remembered a time when he was in the same position and someone cared for him. He did not need to be the star of the story, because helping the stranger in need brought him joy. 

We’ve all experienced times when we were broken and hurting, and brought to caring hands by the gracious Father.  During our times of joy, let us see those who are in the same position we once were.  Let us help them to the throne room to receive God’s healing grace.  Let us be innkeepers to our neighbors. 

Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”  -[Luke 10:37][1]
