[**Titus 3:1-11**][1]

When we read Titus, it should be noted that, although the letter was sent to Titus, it was and is intended for the benefit of all the faithful. In other words, we should read Titus while substituting our own name in the text. As such Paul warns each of us that, in winning disciples for the Lord, we shouldn’t get involved in foolish discussions and quarrels.

In rebuking the foolishness of the world, and we should, we need to be aware of how well we “read the room”. When does our listener feel guided and at what point does our listener feel pushed? In our sermon at Flatland Sunday, Mitchell did a fine job of illustrating this point with magnets. With the right approach, one magnet is attracted to the other, while with a different approach, magnets are repelled away from one another. And no matter how much we chase after that magnet with the wrong approach, we just keep pushing it further away. Continuing to push an uncomfortable person’s buttons is a sure way to lose them altogether.

Paul addresses this cause of division in the church and gives us a rather curt but conclusive directive to deal with it. If we see unproductive discussions, the likes of which cause division instead of unity we need to have a personal and private discussion with the believer who’s demonstrating irritating behavior. If this believer doesn’t cease and desist all such divisive talk, he or she is to be granted a second warning. After that, if this person doesn’t repent, we should have nothing more to do with them for they have turned away from the truth. It’s not us, but their sins which condemn them. As we move to the center, we need to constantly check  ourselves on this. We need to treat any temptation within us to engage in divisive discussions as if it were trash. We must take it out and leave it out so we can be and have a clean temple for the Holy Spirit to dwell.

> _Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees[b] or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws. These things are useless and a waste of time._ -Titus 3:9 NLT
