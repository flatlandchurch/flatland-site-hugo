What am I here for? An interesting question which often elicits a multitude of answers. Unfortunately, the answers are almost always self-centered although there are some altruistic. However, unless the answer is all about our relationship with God, serving Him and His purpose, the answer is wrong.

Well, maybe not wrong wrong but look at what Peter said in his first letter when discussing living for God and the resulting persecution. “…they (Christians who suffer for Christ) do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God…. They (the world) are surprised that you do not join them…. So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.” ([1 Peter 4][1])

It needs to be noted that Peter says, “those who suffer according to God’s will”. The world does not suffer gladly those who live according to God’s will. Those who understand what we are here for will find themselves opposed by the world because the world has a completely different idea of our life’s purpose. Simply put, the closer we get to God, the farther we get from the world and that is intolerable to the world.

The closer we get to God, the closer we also get to each other. Peter says, “Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.” [1 Peter 4:8][2] He continues with other instructions regarding how to live well together and to “commit themselves to their faithful Creator” Why?

> “_…so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen._”

### Reflection
Does my life reflect the glory and power of God or my own self-centered desires?
