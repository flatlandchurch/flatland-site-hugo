[Genesis 13-16][main]

The story of Abraham and Lot is a great picture of making the wrong decisions caused by rebellion. The start of the story is one of conflict. Abraham and Lot’s herdsman are fighting over resources, they have legitimate issues, not enough for everyone. Abraham makes the decision to split up with Lot and gives Lot a choice where he wants to go. Lot of course chooses the best area, perfect for his flocks. But he also chooses to live near Sin City, otherwise known as Sodom. Everything up to this point has been one bad decision after another; fighting, splitting up, allowing an immature chooser choose, and finally the choice to live near a wicked people.

Everything starts with the fighting. The herdsman (as well as Abraham and Lot) could have tried to work together to expand and stay together. But instead they rebelled against each other, each side feeling that they had the right to what they needed. Note that Abraham is the one who has the ownership, it is he that offers one side or the other to Lot. In a sense, he is giving Lot a third choice, to stick with Abraham and figure out how to live together.

But Lot sees this as an opportunity to be free! His freedom didn’t last. He finds himself in the middle of a war and is captured. _If he had stayed with Abraham, he would have been safe._ Instead, he has to be rescued by Abraham. But  after rescue he goes back to his old haunts, he gets caught up being surrounded by evil. He ends up loosing practically everything because he rebels against doing the right thing.

Our rebellious hearts are just like Lot. We quarrel, looking for freedom from constraints that God has established. God provides us with the choice and we all too often make the wrong decisions, moving away from God to what looks to be greener pastures. And we get captured. And we find ourselves running for our lives as our world comes crashing down around us, loosing everything we had worked for. But God calls us to stay with Him, to move closer to Him instead of moving away. God provides shelter from the storm, He provides safety from the wilds of life, [He provides everything we need][need]. We need to turn our rebellious hearts over to Him, let Him quell our quarrels, and find rest.

> _Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light._ -[Matthew 11:28-30][matt]
