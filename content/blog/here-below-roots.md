In [The Parable of the Weeds][1], we learn that we are all weeds; but when we receive the good seed, or the Word of God, we are transformed into a shaft of wheat.  

The roots of wheat reach a depth of about 3 ½ feet in the spring.  By the winter, those same roots have reached a depth of over 7 feet. In the following spring, the wheat is ready to harvest. 

How deep are your roots? When you made the decision to follow Jesus, your roots took to the soil. As you move to the center of God’s kingdom, your roots grow deeper. The deeper your roots, the less likelihood that the weeds planted by the enemy will uproot you.

How deep are your roots?  Are you content to stay in your first spring, or will you grow deeper in your faith over the winter, and be ready for the harvest?  

Just as the farmer fertilizes the wheat, we must nourish our faith by:
* Rejoicing, Praying, and Giving Thanks.
> _Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you._  -[Thessalonians 5:16-18][2]
* Reading the Word.
> _So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ._ -[Romans 10:17][3]
* Putting Christ in the center of your life.
> _So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness._ -[Colossians 2:6][4]
