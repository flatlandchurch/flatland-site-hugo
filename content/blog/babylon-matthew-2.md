[**Matthew 2**][1]

Seeking absolute control by any means, including murder, is Babylon’s mode of operation. Here we see another example Israel being attacked by Babylon from within. In this case, Herod has access to holy scriptures as well as experts in the study of them. His advisors basically tell Herod that God’s promised Messiah has been born and that, furthermore, He was born in Bethlehem fulfilling God’s prophecy.

The problem is that Herod has become so accustomed to sitting in the seat of power, he’s actually allowed himself to believe the throne belongs to him instead of seeing it as a tool belonging to God. As such he takes the thought of relinquishing this tool to anyone, including the Messiah – the rightful owner – as a personal attack. He panics instead of celebrating in thanksgiving to God for faithfully fulfilling His promise. See how emptying himself of God provides enough room for evil to move in and completely possess Herod.

Can you think of other times and places where this form of evil possession has taken place? As U. S. citizens, we need look no further than the land between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Many indigenous people were massacred in their homes. The survivors were removed, imprisoned on desert land, and given no voice in government, all in the name of establishing absolute control.

Are you, even partially, a willing subject to Babylon’s evil possession? When possession of “your stuff” is challenged, do you panic instead of leaning in closer to God? How could practicing generosity fill your life with eternal peace instead of temporary stuff?

**Teaching about Money and Possessions**
> _Don’t store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be._ Matthew 6:19-21 NLT
