[**Titus 2**][1]

I have been fascinated by churches who proudly say they are unaffiliated with any denomination. Sometimes they think that somehow the doctrines/dogma of a denomination is a negative, a straight jacket. When the Assemblies of God was founded, they didn’t want to use the word doctrine because of this bias so they called it the “[Statement of Fundamental Truths][ag].” But those Fundamental Truths were a simple restatement of historic doctrines that had been taught in the church from the beginning. The problem really was that non-biblical ideas had been incorporated into the doctrines of many churches, often leading to legalism, false practices, or vitriolic bickering between denominations.

It is foundational that we individually and corporately as a church have firm and sound doctrine. Paul is clear on this with Titus. _But we can’t just go making up whatever we think to be our “sound doctrine”._ Churches and people that want to be independent from the guidance of established doctrines are in danger of sliding into teachings that are not Biblical, a salvation not from Christ. The Church has gone through several times of battle over the fundamental truths. But God has ensured that we have come out with truths that most churches can agree upon. As mentioned in [an previous post][early], the early Church’s Apostolic Creed is a distillation of those beliefs and the A/G’s Statement of Fundamental Truths is a great modern declaration of the doctrines we need to know, understand, and believe ([see also Flatland Church’s video][flat]).  They will help keep us on the move to the center.

But we can not stop there. We must then share the Good News, for that is what those sound doctrines Paul mentions help us proclaim, the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As we move to the center we are called to help others to move too. We do this with confidence when we are based in the sound doctrine taught by the church. Learn sound doctrine and pass it on to others. Let’s move!

> _Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”_ -[Matthew 28:18-20][gc]
