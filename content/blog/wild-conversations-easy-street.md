[**Acts 21:1-14**][1]

People generally mean well, but all of us must choose between the two paths available for us to walk. There’s the easy, broad street, which may be paved with good intentions, but [always leads to death and destruction.][7] Sadly, the vast majority in the world hope for a gospel that makes them happy, healthy and wealthy. However, our Savior, Jesus taught in both word and deed that the way of life is a hard road with only a few on it. [Ironically, this hard road ends in life.][2]

Some people, shortly after hearing from the Holy Spirit concerning the mission in store for the Apostle Paul, [mimicked][3] Peter’s reaction shortly after God revealed to him that [Jesus is the true Messiah.][4] Like Peter, they wanted their loved one to avoid hardship and take the easy street. Here Paul, who loves them, can feel their pain. Paul confronts them for it by declaring that they are [breaking his heart][5] and asks a direct question “why all this crying?”. _This is not rhetorical, Paul’s question demands an answer, even from us today._ We must fully examine the motivation behind any reluctance we have to spreading the Gospel.

Fearing the loss of life is normal, as is the desire to avoid pain. This is actually how God designed us and it keeps us from unnecessary risks such as crossing the street without looking both ways. But when it comes to loving this life above our eternal purpose, our response is contrary to the will of God and, therefore, fraught with our own demise. We need never have thoughts of an easy job in spreading the Gospel after Jesus told us it would be extremely hard. As Paul modeled perfectly, engaging in [wild and potentially dangerous][6] conversations is the only way the Good News has endured to reached us. And it’s the same way you and I must boldly and intentionally reach out to this generation today.

**The Narrow and Wide Gates**
> _“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it”_ Matthew 7:13-14 NIV
