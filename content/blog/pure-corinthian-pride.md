It’s reported to Paul that a man is living in sin with his father’s wife.  And the church in Corinth is literally puffed up with pride in the matter.  How many problems can we find [in just these two verses][week1]?  And, even before you begin counting, you already know that problems require problem solvers.  The phrase “I’m just going to let that problem solve itself” is absurd because problems, by definition, are neither interested in, nor in the business of, solving themselves.

First of all, let’s be clear that we’re addressing the issue of unrepentant sin, because the text is clear on this.  And Paul is addressing a lifestyle which is neither socially, nor politically correct.  It’s assumed as inherently evil by worldly standards, let alone God’s higher and infinitely right standard for His people.  Has this church taken good things like compassion and tolerance to an extreme and perverted level?  Have they become so proud of their own ability to tolerate that they’ve come to completely refuse God’s directive to engage in problem solving?

Another possible source of their pride may come from the thought that this sinner may be in church leadership.  Perhaps he’s a gifted speaker and is skilled in reaching multitudes.  Suppose we’ve got one such leader and we’re proud of it.  Suppose we were so proud of having such skill under our roof that we were willing to overlook faults so we don’t lose face/pride with the public.  Whatever the reason, one of the numerous sins of both commission and omission Paul addresses in the opening two verses is the sin of pride and how it has no place in the church.  It can’t be tolerated and, therefore must be solved to total eradication.

What pride is in you that enables you to overlook even a little sin in your life?
