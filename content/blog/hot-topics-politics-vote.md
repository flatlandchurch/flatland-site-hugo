**[Romans 13:1-7][1]**

Recently we celebrated July 4th, Independence Day. This passage brings to mind the question, were our founding fathers wrong? Should they have submitted to King George despite the awful state of affairs. I can’t say for certain but to me, God had appointed new authorities over this land, ones that would lead a new nation, under God. They certainly felt that way as we see in the [Declaration of Independence][3].  

Our governing body today is one that we elect, one that we choose... or it is one that we can allow _others who do not follow God_ to choose a different way and force it upon us. We have a great privilege granted to us by the law, let us take every advantage to submit ourselves to God, ask Him for guidance, and vote. That way we will not have to be subjects to a godless nation as some would have it.

> _I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people— for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people.._ [1 Timothy 2:1-6 (NIV)][2]
