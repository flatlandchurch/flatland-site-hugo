[**Today’s reading: John 20**][jhn20]

The single most important event in history occurs on the first Sunday following the crucifixion of Jesus, Mary Magdalene goes to the tomb before sunrise to prepare Jesus’ body for proper burial. She looks in, sees the empty tomb, and leaves to tell the disciples. She finds Peter and John together, and the three of them run to the gravesite. John arrives first, but Peter is the first to enter the tomb.  He finds it empty as Mary had said.  The graveclothes have been left in the grave. Note that, unlike Lazarus who came forth along with his graveclothes (he’ll need his graveclothes again), Jesus doesn’t.

Evidence of the resurrection is plentiful. If thieves had somehow overcome the guard, their purpose would most likely have been to steal the fine linens and leave the body. On the other hand, if the goal was to steal the body, it would have made more sense to carry it out “as-is”. A quick getaway would be impossible if they had taken time to separate and sort things at the scene.  Additional evidence for the resurrection is found in Hebrew prophecy which states that the Christ must rise from the dead and Jesus confirmed this prophecy with His own word prior to his arrest. And, on this day, Jesus graciously and intentionally shows Himself alive as He and Mary converse.  Of course, this sampling isn’t an exhaustive list of evidence of the resurrection provided by eye witnesses.

Through His death, the penalty of sin was paid in full. Jesus conquered our debt. But, of what value is paying the cost for sin if Jesus had remained in the grave. If He had not also conquered death, we would have a glorious free ticket for no destination beyond the grave. The most amazing fact, found only in Christianity, is that death has been destroyed for all who put their faith in Christ Jesus.

> _Then Jesus said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand into the wound in my side. Don’t be faithless any longer. Believe!”_

> _“My Lord and my God!” Thomas exclaimed._

> _Then Jesus told him, “You believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me.”_ -[John 20:27-29 (NLT)][jhn2027]

> _If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved._ -[Romans 10:9 (NLT)][rom109]
