#### [Hebrews 8][heb8]

There are only a few times in the Bible which speaks of God writing something. Most of the time, we find God telling someone to write something down, [in a book][jer30], or [on a scroll][isa8] or [even on a stick][ezk37]. We often think of Moses chiseling out the words on the stone tablets but Moses writes in [Deuteronomy][deu5] “Then he [God] wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.” (see also [Exodus 32:15-16][ex32]) So significant is this that when Moses broke those tablets of stone in anger, God made Moses chisel out two more tablets so that [God could write the words again][deu10].

Why is this important? We often find God doing something early in the Bible to illustrate an important truth that we find later in Scripture. The Ten Commandments were a part of the covenant God had with the people of Israel. The remaining words of the covenant, God entrusted Moses to write out for Him, but the important words were written in stone by the Lord God Almighty.  Despite that, the people of Israel could not obey them. Obedience to the Law is hard, downright impossible! Another step is required.

[Jeremiah prophesied][jer31] that step and [Hebrews says][heb8] that prophecy was fulfilled. A new covenant, a new law was established through the blood of Jesus. However, this covenant was not written in stone which could easily [be smashed upon the rocks][ex32] or on a scroll to be [burned in the fire.][jer36]. The new covenant is written on our hearts and in our minds. God takes up a chisel to write His love for us in us. He marks us as His own. He desires to write our story, a love story, a story of triumph.

### Challenge
- God has a chisel in His hands right now, ready to engrave His name in your heart and mind, will you let Him?
