In the [parable of the persistent widow][1], we’re given a rare look at the point, or the “key” if you will, at the very start. We, God’s elect, should pray and never cease. Why? The parable concludes with a final sentence which most of us may have read, but didn’t “notice”, “when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?’” The persistence of prayer is essential for daily needs, but most especially for our eternal needs. Therefore, we must never lose heart, even when Jesus seems to us to be delayed.

Here, we have a widow victimized and seeking restoration.  In a world where women have no rights, one having no husband to protect her and speak for her, a widow becomes easy prey.  Like the widow, we are easy prey in that we are no match for our adversary, Satan.  Therefore, we need to be relentless as the widow in seeking protection and restoration from his daily plunderous raids on our peace and our assurance in Christ.

Faith in an unfailing God, and endurance when He seems to be delayed in coming, are essential characteristics of all believers in Christ.  Nevertheless, many of those who believe themselves to be devoted the Lord will become weary of pursuing and waiting on Him. When Jesus poses the question as to whether he will find true rock-solid faith on earth, the text implies a strong “no, He will not” and He foresees it. But this is our comfort, that Jesus always responds in perfect time, both now, and in the day to come.

The Son of Man will come again, that’s guaranteed.  And it will be obvious to his “chosen ones” (v7) that the unbelief of man has not made the promises of God ineffective.

> _Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen on your walls;  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will pray day and night, continually.  
> Take no rest, all you who pray to the LORD.  
> Give the LORD no rest until he completes his work,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until he makes Jerusalem the pride of the earth._ -[Isaiah 62:6-7 (NLT)][2]
