**[Joshua 1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua1-5)**

Joshua became the leader of the Israelites after Moses's death.  How did he rise to this position?  He became Moses's aide when he was a young man, appointed as a representative of his Israeli tribe to spy out the land of Canaan.  Joshua later led the Israeli army into victory in the battle against the Amalekites.  Joshua accompanied Moses to Mount Sinai to receive the ten commandments.  When the time came to choose a leader to take the people to the promised land, Joshua was the chosen one.

Who does God call to lead his people?    How do we know when we are being called into leadership?  Let's look at Joshua's example.

* Joshua was a loyal follower. Joshua 1:5
* Joshua was a humble servant. [Joshua 7:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua7:6)
* Joshua trusted in the Lord. Joshua 1:13
* Joshua was faithful. Joshua 1:9
* Joshua was obedient.  Joshua 1:17

It was Moses who followed God's command to appoint Joshua as his successor.
> _So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit of leadership, and lay your hand on him._ [Numbers 27:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers27:18)

God's calling may come to you through another person, someone who has witnessed your loyalty, humility, trust, faithfulness, obedience.  This person has had a nudge from God to choose you. Or, perhaps no one asks you.  Perhaps you read about the need in the weekly bulletin.  Or you sense that there is a need for leadership in an area of the church in which you're involved.  Or it's announced, you hear it in passing, you feel you have a talent that could fill it.  Any of these may be your Joshua call. We need to then respond.

> _"But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serveâ€¦ But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."_  Joshua 24:15
