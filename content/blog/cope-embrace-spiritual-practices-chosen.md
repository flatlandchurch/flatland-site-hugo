[John 15:1-17][3]

We all have times in our lives when we wanted something but weren’t chosen.  We weren’t chosen for the team we wanted to be on, for the job we wanted.  Perhaps we weren’t chosen as our mother’s favorite, or as the teacher’s pet.  It can be disheartening, discouraging, downright defeating to be overlooked and disregarded, or to watch someone else get what we feel we deserve.

The good news is that we’re all chosen by Christ.  John spoke to his disciples in the upper room, hours before his execution.

> _You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you._  ~[John 15:16][1]

Now when we weren’t chosen for the team or for the job, we were defeated because we wanted it so badly.  Maybe we worked hard for it, maybe it was our dream.  But this calling from Christ does not require any work, it does not show favor, it is given freely to all who choose to accept it.

If we ignored the invitation to join the team, or the offer of the dream job, we would most likely have regrets.  Why did I pass up that opportunity, which may never come my way again?  The biggest regret of our lives comes with the missed opportunity to serve Christ.  The good news is that this isn’t a one time opportunity; it is always free and readily available to all who choose to accept it.  There are no try-outs or interviews and we don’t have to perform perfectly.  It is never too late to accept our appointment.

> _By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples._~[John 15:8][2]
