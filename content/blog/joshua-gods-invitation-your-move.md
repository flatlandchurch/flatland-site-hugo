**[Joshua 23-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua23-24)**

I noticed a funny thing on Halloween, on our side of the block, every house had the porch lights on while on the other side of the block there were five houses in a row that were very dark. The lights were invitations to the trick-r-treaters to come get candy while the dark houses were ominously rejecting the children.

God puts out an invitation to us all. Ironically, we are the houses dark and ominous. We have no candy to give out, we don't want our doors knocked upon but Christ none the less knocks. John says that Jesus came as light in the darkness but the darkness rejected him, "yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God" [John 1:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John1:12)

It was a fact that the people of Israel were God's people but they had to live in God's light. They had to choose to walk in it and serve God on a daily basis throwing away everything that would distract them from their walk with God. They had to choose God's invitation or walk away. In the same way, we must continually choose to follow Christ, to walk in his light. We must throw away that which would distract us and throw open our doors to him.

> _"Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me."_ -[Revelation 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation3:20)
