### [Luke 12:22-34][1]

Four words that Jesus speaks cuts to the bone, "you of little faith!" (Luke 12:28) I hear those words and want to cry out like the man, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!" [Mark 9:24 (NIV)][2] We worry, we fret, we plan our future and save everything from our past just in case. We burden ourselves with emotional baggage and a garage full of junk because we have such little faith.

Jesus tells us how he will help us overcome our unbelief, "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (v34) When our treasure is Christ, when we seek his kingdom first, when we pray with meaning, "your kingdom come, your will be done" we can then continue with confidence "Give us today our daily bread" [(Lord's Prayer)][3] and live the rest of the day without a weight on our back because we will know our Father in heaven will take care of us. When our heart is on God, when our lives are dedicated wholly to Christ, we can then travel light.

> _Trust in the Lord with all your heart_
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;and lean not on your own understanding;_
> _in all your ways submit to him,_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_and he will make your paths straight._ -[Proverbs 3:5-10][4]

### Action
Spend time in prayer today re-dedicating your life to the Lord, crying out like the [man in Mark][2], "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
