_Youâ€™re known by the company you keep__ is a popular phrase meaning we are judged by the people we associate with.  Though a person may be an honest upright citizen, he may be perceived as otherwise if his closest friends are liars and cheaters.

In addition to the image we project to others, the company we keep can either cause us to lose focus on God or can help us grow closer to the center of His kingdom.  Our people can lead us off track or help us stay in step with Christ. When we are in close relationships with other believers, we have people to pray for us, support us, encourage us, exhort us and serve alongside us. We have people that we can minister to.

Friendships can be hard to let go of, but sometimes we may need to clean out our friendship closet and _surround ourselves with others who will continue to inspire us  to our betterment_ [(Proverbs 13:20)][1].  Who is bringing you down and who is lifting you up?

>_Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth_ [(2 Timothy 2:15)][2].
