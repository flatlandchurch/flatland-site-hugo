[**1 John 3**][1jn3]

There seems to nothing worse than a guilty conscience except maybe a feeling of being guilty when we are not. Satan would love to make us walk around feeling guilty for every little thing we do, to believe that we are not worthy of forgiveness by the Father. We walk around with heavy hearts **but God wants something different.**

John says [“God is greater than our hearts.”][1jn320] No matter what lies the old devil tries to tell us, when we believe in the name of His Son, [we have been made righteous][1jn33]. As such, we need to allow the Spirit to strengthen our hearts, to give us confidence before God. He is greater. We can know that “we belong to the truth”. We can “set our hearts at rest in his presence” especially when our hearts seem to waver, quiver, and fear. If we do sin, [“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.”][1jn19] Yes, “God is greater.”

> “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!” -1 John 3:1
