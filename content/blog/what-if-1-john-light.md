**Today’s Reading: [1 John 1:5-10][1jn15] - Light**

What if there was no light in the world?  We need light to guide us in the darkness.  The moon and stars served as navigators long before technology.  Light is needed in order for vegetation to grow.  The human body craves the sunlight.  Without it we lack Vitamin D and serotonin and can become physically and mentally ill.   If we claim to have light in our lives, to be in good health and to be guided in the darkness with beautiful flowers and nourishing vegetables, we would be lying.  Nothing is possible without light. 

Apart from Jesus, we live in another kind of darkness.  We stumble on our journey with no light to guide us, nothing to help us grow.  Our lives are not fully complete because we are created to crave our Creator. 

Christ was present at the creation of the world, where on the first day of creation [God said “Let there be light,” and there was light.][gen13] As the author of creation He has the authority to illuminate His creation in its truest form.  He is the outer recognition of His Father’s creation and presence, and the inward dwelling of the Holy Spirit, by which we know our Father and walk with Jesus. Only through a relationship with Jesus can the dark parts of our hearts brighten.  Through Him and His sacrificial death on the cross, we are exposed to the light and of our sins.  Jesus is the Light of the world, our world, and in the world.  Is the light on in your world? 

> _God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth._ -[1John 1:5][1jn15]
