[**Titus 1:8-9**][tit18]

[The early church had a great sense of community][acts2], devotion to each other, devotion to the teachings of Christ. They met daily in the temple courts, a practice they probably picked up from Jesus.  Being in the temple courts, they were very public in their devotion to each other as well as their public teaching of the principles of the Gospel.  Their love and sacrifice for each other was a key characteristic of Christians which drew people to Christ. The phrase in [Acts 2][acts2], “And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved” is a goal for which our church should strive.

As we read Acts 2:42-47 we see several important actions that helped the church multiply. First, they proclaimed the Good News of Jesus Christ. Part of that teaching was the Eucharist taken daily in the temple, a physical way to remind each other the truth of the Gospel and to teach non-believers as they explained why they celebrated. Another part of the proclamation of the Gospel was the signs and miracles performed, again, right there in front of everyone. It was an amazing time... and one that we can still experience if we just believe and act.

The other important action that the early believers did was showing love to one another in very practical ways. This demonstration of love entailed sacrifice&mdash;selling possessions to provide for others&mdash;again, something they learned from Jesus. It is sad that in just a few years the early believers lost this practical demonstration of love. James, brother of Jesus and leader of the church in Jerusalem, [had to scold the believers in Jerusalem][jam2] for their lack action. [John in his first letter][1jo3] also had to remind the believers that love for each other is “with actions and in truth.” When we have a loving community where we sacrifice for each other (and I believe Flatland does and we need to continue to strive), we will achieve the goal “and the Lord added to their number.” Let’s move!

> _This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth._ -[1 John 3:16-18][1jo3]
