#### [Psalm 37][ps37]
The world is crazy out there! I cringe and hide in the basement of my house and hope it all goes away. If I step out my door, I am immediately overwhelmed by everything that assaults me; fear of catching “it”, being told I need to have “that”, how I need to look like “this”, what I need to be doing “there”. I am reminded of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins who said it is a dangerous thing to step out your door, you never know where you might be swept off to. Life is overwhelming and it would seem that there are a whole lot of conflicting voices arguing over what is the best way to handle it. But God is the answer, if we but listen to His voice.

Jesus maybe is considered audacious when he said, [“Don’t worry!”][worry] but he had fairly persuasive reasoning. He asks, “If God cares about all the flowers and the birds how much more does He care for us?” When we believe in Him, begin to put our lives into the hands of the almighty God, allowing Him to lead us and guide us, His [peace][peace] and [joy][joy] will begin to overwhelm everything else life throws at us.

### Reflections
* Which is more important to God, a bird or you?
* If God is for you, who (what) can be against you? ([Romans 8:31][rom])

> _Trust in the LORD and do good;   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.    
> Delight yourself in the LORD,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He will give you the desires of your heart.   
> Commit your way to the LORD;    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust in Him, and He will do it.   
> He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn,    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your justice like the noonday sun.   
> Be still before the LORD   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wait patiently for Him;_ -[Psalm 37][ps37]
