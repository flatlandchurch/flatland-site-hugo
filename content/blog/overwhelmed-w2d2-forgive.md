#### [Luke 23:34][1]
Jesus has been mocked, beaten, humiliated, and nailed to a cross. He is in excuciating pain, looking down on those who had hung him on the cross, and he utters what can only be a shocking statement, “Father, forgive them....” Instead of cursing his cruel tormentors, he forgives them, just as the [Father forgives][2] each and every one of us, when we believe.

Some might argue, “But God doesn’t expect us to do the same thing.” Unfortunately for those who don’t want to follow Jesus’ example, God made sure we know what the right thing to do. In [Acts 7][3] we read about the stoning of Stephen, one of the first 7 deacons of the church. Stephen’s last words, as rocks were probably still being hurled at him were, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.”

We have no excuse. God makes it pretty clear in many places, forgiveness is manditory in the life of a Christian’s life. [Jesus teaches us this in the Lord’s Prayer][4], an example of how we are to pray. Forgiveness is important. We are to ask God to forgive us in the same manner as we have forgiven. When we do not forgive, we are overwhelmed with the burden of unforgiveness.

How can we do this? There is only one way, the way Christ showed us on the cross, the way God showed us when He gave His only Son, the way of love. Love frees us from the overwhelming burden of unforgiveness as we follow Jesus’ example, “Father, forgive them.”

> _Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity._ -Colossians 3:12-14 NIV

### Challenge
Seek God’s leading for whom you might need to forgive (again) and ask Him to help lift that burden by filling you with His love for that person.
