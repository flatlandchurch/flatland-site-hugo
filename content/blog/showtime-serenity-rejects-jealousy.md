[**James 4:1-3**][1]

If we’re honest, most of us can admit that we experience a sense of lacking (at least from time to time). We sometimes feel incomplete and jealous of those who have or seem to have something we don’t. So, we allow ourselves to think that if we chase after that thing (item, respect, promotion…), once achieved, we’ll live our life in contentment and serenity. For the times we’ve actually believed any, or for that matter, all of the world’s offerings can complete us, I have to ask: “How’s that working out for you?” Don’t we go right back to square one the minute something else catches our eye? Living like this is sinful; it shows us that, although lavished with the Lord’s gifts, we’re dissatisfied with Him. And, we’re robbing from ourselves; we’re adamantly rejecting the abundant serenity and joy offered to us in the Lord’s presence. Serenity, on the other hand, rejects and abolishes jealousy, yielding freedom from the insatiable bondage of covetousness.

We should note that our eyes are almost always the gateway to sin. This entryway into sin may seem unique to us or even a relatively modern issue, but it’s been around since day one. God gifted Adam and Eve with his presence every day. And, if that weren’t enough (and it certainly is), He gifted them with all of creation, saving only one thing for Himself. [Genesis 3:6][2] tells us that the minute mankind looked upon something they didn’t have, they became jealous; they coveted it. This sense of dissatisfaction in the presence of the Lord is deplorable. It’s sin in its original state. And it’s at the very root of the void of peace within ourselves and, as a direct result, the world. It’s been going on forever, and if it could ever be remedied by anything of the world, it would have been done long ago.

Suppose I told you I’d give you 100 million dollars, but if you accepted it, you’d be dead by tomorrow. Would you take it? Of course not! Life without money is full of all variety of joys and opportunities, but money without life is worthless. Similarly, all the goods in the world are worthless apart from the life in which Jesus has gifted us. Our eternal life isn’t some futuristic pipe dream to be chased, but a present reality. We’re already living our eternal life right now because God is already with us. Think of it, once you have God, what more is there? What needs to be added to God to make us better? If you really want to live life full of serenity – in absolute peace – put yourself in a place where God is catching your eye, not the world. After all, He’s already in your room. Just let Him know that you notice Him. Speak with Him a little more and take Him for granted a little less.

### Reflections
- Have you scheduled a meeting with God in your quiet place today to talk about the root cause/s of stress in your life?
- Do you have any other appointments on your calendar today that you think will give you greater peace?
