#### [1 John 1:8-10][1jn]

John was all about Jesus. He has many ways to refer to Jesus some of which are obvious, some not; Messiah, Son of God, Son of Man, the Word, the Truth, the I Am, the Light, and Lamb of God are just half of the names John uses to refer to Jesus in his gospel, just read the [first chapter][jn1] for at least 7. When we are reading his letters, we need to keep our eyes open for key words because even when he doesn’t say Jesus directly, Jesus is there.

Reading 1 John 1 we are immediately struck by John’s emphasis on the absolute truth that Jesus was a real person through whom we receive salvation. John was an eye witness to everything Jesus said and did. John knew the truth because he knew The Truth and John lived the truth. John wants us to have that same knowledge. Truth, light and forgiveness are what we receive and walk in with joy.

But to live in the Truth we have to be truthful. There are two key phrases that we need to see in 1 John 1:8-10; “the truth is not in us” and “his word is not in us”. Remember when I say we need to keep our eyes open when reading John’s letters. John maybe saying very subtilely, “Jesus is not in us.” We have to be truthful to ourselves, others, and to God. We are sinful and need forgiveness. When we bow before God...

> _If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.... If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness._ -1 John 1:9

### Challenge
- Have you been real with yourself regarding your sin?
- Is the Truth in you?
- Is His Word in you?
- Have you confessed those sins to God?
