#### [John 8:12][1]

Jesus doesn’t just save us – of course, He does this – but He’s also a [light to our path.][2] He’s a leader, and He’s good at it. He leads the way for us into life. What we need to see is exactly which path He’s shining his light onto because the enemy is shining a counterfeit light on the path that leads to eternal destruction. And Satan is also good at what he does. In fact, he’s the master over all master manipulators. Competing in the manipulation ring against Satan would result in a loss as surely as competing in the boxing ring against Oleksandr Usyk (current heavyweight champion).

What we need is miraculous power to defeat this extremely powerful enemy, And prayer is essential. We know that, many times, we focus our prayers on the “defensive”. I mean, we often petition God for things like protection and healing. Sometimes our prayers look like this: “God save me from this” and “God rescue me from that”. These are good and vital prayers. But God really wants us to view prayer as offensive. God needs us to reclaim territory that was stolen by the enemy. And we need a solid battle plan.

Think of how successful your employment network would be without plans. The truth is establishing a “battle plan” is essential for nearly every job on a daily basis in order to illuminate the path of success. And even if you’re not involved in daily meetings, you’re at least networking on a weekly basis. So, since we know that our family doesn’t exist to support our job, it’s the purpose of our job to support our family, we have to know that our family network collaboration meetings are even more essential than our professional network collaboration meetings. The age-old saying: “The family that prays together stays together” isn’t just a catchy cliché. It’s the truth.

But meetings don’t just appear on our calendars; we have to put them there. So don’t expect your family to just happen to come together for a discussion on which path you all want to take for the next seven days. Of course, we all want to take the path Jesus is illuminating to eternal life. But without collaboration, we’re taking an offensive position against an incredibly fortified enemy without [God’s battle plan.][3]

### Challenges
- How would Satan feel if you thought he posed no harmful threat to you?
- How does Jesus feel when you allow Him to empower you to overcome all threats?
- Put a family strategy meeting, including time for a Bible passage and prayer, on your family calendar today – and select: “recurring”.
