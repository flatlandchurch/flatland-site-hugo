### [Philippians 1][1]

“So that”.  What comes to mind when you read or hear these two small words?  In most cases, it means everything.  The whole purpose behind whatever came before these words is now to be revealed.  “In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5 NIV).  Wouldn’t we be great if we could have the same mindset as Jesus?  Lofty as the notion may sound, that’s exactly what we strive for; to become great.  True greatness does not in any way conflict with true humility, it’s nothing to be avoided.  In fact, it’s necessary.

What follows the “so that” in this case tells us who we are.  So that we can lord our greatness over others, so that we can look at ourselves and see how we have risen above common mankind is one mindset, just not the mindset of Jesus.  Jesus is the Son of God and we are grafted into Him as one, making us great Princes and Princesses of the Most-High King.  However, our Father has no favorite children, and when we get the notion that we’re Dad’s favorite, we can expect correction much like we would if we were overheard by our parents saying that to a sibling.

Jesus, God, humbled himself so that we could be served by Him.  His big “so that” is so that we could be saved and come home with him.  We must move to the center of God’s Kingdom so that we become great so that His church can be made up of greatness so that the entire world can be humbly served.  And ultimately, so that all of our siblings can come home.

> _**so that** at the name of Jesus&hellip;_<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_every knee should bow&hellip;_<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_every tongue acknowledge_<br>
> _Jesus Christ is Lord_<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_to the glory of God the Father_ -[Philippians 2:6-11][1]
