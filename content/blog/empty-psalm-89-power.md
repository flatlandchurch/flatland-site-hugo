[**Psalm 89**][1]

_The highest angelic powers stand in awe of God. He is far more awesome than all who surround his throne_ (v7). Keep this truth in the forefront of your mind at all times because there will be times in your life when you’re tempted to feel empty and powerless.

When we’ve been hurt by someone, we’re may feel empty because we feel our power has been taken from us. Instead of releasing these feelings to God, one way we deal with them is to try to regain our sense of empowerment by getting even - [revenge][2]. Or, we may go the opposite direction and hold onto the belief that there are those with more access to power than we have. In this case, we embrace a lower viewpoint of ourselves compared with others. Either way, when we feel empty, we’re disregarding the power of God who lives in us.

Evil forces will always be responsible for influencing others to hurt us. But putting these people or ourselves down keeps us from focusing on the all-powerful God who dwells within us. Our God will exact perfect justice for all wrongs and subdue every other authority in the universe. Our job is to release our hurts, our insecurities, and our emptiness to God and He who is all powerful will completely fill you with the power of His Holy Spirit. The same power that raised Jesus from the dead is available for you.

> _For who in all of heaven can compare with the Lord? What mightiest angel is anything like the Lord?_ Psalm 89:6 NLT
