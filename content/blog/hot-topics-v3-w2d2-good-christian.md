#### [Matthew 23:23][2]

[Sunday I got a chuckle when Adam said][1] something like, “There is no such thing as a “good Christian” - we are just Christians, stinky, smelly, people.” The thought Adam expressed was a lot of people tithe to be a “good Christian.” But a “good Christian” that relies on tithing as a badge for being “good” is just like the [Pharisees that Jesus condemned][2]. It is Christ that makes us good.

So why tithe? Because stinky smelly Christians tithe out of love. When Jesus condemned the Pharisees he said, ”you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness.” Justice, mercy, and faithfulness are expressions of love. [Jesus once answered the question][3] of what the greatest law is by saying love God and love people.  “All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” When we love God and people our actions will reflect that love. Our giving flows out of our love, not an obligation or badge of goodness.

So when we give we don’t do it to be called good as if that would somehow make us acceptable to God. We don’t give to get accolades like the Pharisees, that is so temporary and it stops there. We give to a good good Father because He loves us and has blessed us. We give to a good good Father because we love others and want to move with them to the center of the Father's kingdom. Let's move.

### Challenge
- How do you answer the question, “Why tithe?” 
- How do you answer the call, “Love”?
