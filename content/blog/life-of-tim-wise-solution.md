[**2 Timothy 3**][1]

[“You are rock, and upon this rock I will build my church.”][2] When Jesus spoke these words to Simon Peter, He was telling Peter that His church would be built out of stone or rock, the most permanent of building materials. Neither fire, nor flood, nor wind prevails against such a solid structure. And with Jesus as the foundation, all stones supported by Him would remain in place for eternity.  Looking at Timothy, we see that he was one such stone, and Jesus’ church stands today, in part, because of him.

Now, it’s our turn.  We’re the stones Jesus is using to build His church today.  As a Christian, many will attempt to seduce you with worldly rewards such as friendship, popularity, success, etc.  Such empty promises are difficult to recognize as evil especially when presented attractively with flattering and polite words.  But beware.  Wisdom shows us that such attempts are only made to entice you into their culture so as to change you from rock to solute. A sugar cube, for example, will stand firm under pressure many times it’s own weight. But when immersed in water, the sugar cube dissolves and blends in, incapable of upholding any weight whatsoever.

The Christian solution is in the rocks.  We who surround ourselves with rocks are not subject to dissolution.  This is why God told us from the beginning that it’s not good for us to be alone. With [Christ as our cornerstone,][3] we remain rock-steady under the tremendous pressure of dark forces tirelessly working in this world to dilute, and ultimately, defeat truth. So today, take a moment to examine your schedule. Are you spending more of your free time with solid Christians who politely ensure Jesus is included in the conversation or with folks who spend hours on end rudely ignoring Jesus?  Wisdom is calling you to participate in a Life Group where people don’t just want you, they really need you, just like God said.

> _The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”_ Genesis 2:18 NIV
