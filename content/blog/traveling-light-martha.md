### [Luke 10:38-42][1]

During Martha’s interaction with Jesus, He tell her that “few things are needed – or indeed only one”.  Martha was caught up in what she felt were the necessities for her visitors – a clean house, a good meal, comfort – while she was missing the real necessity:  time with Jesus.

The modern woman is depicted by Martha.  We are programmed to take care of others.  We spend our time, when company is present, making sure all their needs are taken care of.  We don’t want anyone to think we’re a bad hostess.  But if we spend too much time on the preparations, we miss out on developing a relationship with our guests.  Jesus told his disciples, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ Matthew 25: 40.  And so we think we’re serving Jesus by serving our guests.

Jesus also said, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ [Matthew 25:45][2].  Perhaps our guests have left our homes with a full stomach, they were warm and comfortable in our home, they think our home is lovely and we’re gracious hostesses.  But, did we sit and listen to them?  Have they left our home with a better relationship with their hostess?

Now Jesus is our guest.  Will we spend our time preparing the meal, or preparing to be still and listen?

> _Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her._  [Luke 10:42][1]

### Questions:
1. When Jesus knocks on your door, will you be more concerned with whether your floors have been swept and mopped, or with the manner in which you’re living your life?
2. Jesus speaks to us all the time.  In the midst of your schedule, obligations, chores, can you stop and listen?
