**[Joshua 23-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua23-24)**

When I was in college, sororities had one standing rule about membership:  the rule of legacy.  That is, if a girl's mother or grandmother belonged to the Greek organization, the sorority was obligated to extend an invitation to the girl.  That was the only guarantee of anyone getting in.  Other girls were chosen by the sorority.  Once invited, the girls could choose whether to join. 

God's kingdom is an eternal organization, one to which all of mankind has a standing invitation.  Whether your parents chose to accept the invitation, whether they were Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist or agnostic or atheist…you have an invitation from God.  

Even if your parents were Christians, just as the girl invited to the sorority as a legacy, you have a choice to make, just as anyone else on the list.   Your father may have been a deacon, your mother the church secretary, you went to Sunday school and attended church faithfully all your life.  But, have you accepted the covenant God has invited you into?  

When we pledged our sorority, we made a promise to "never join any other general Greek letter fraternity".   We became sisters to one another.  God asks us to make a promise to never serve any other God but Him.  Serve Him with all faithfulness.  You're invited to be a child of God, a brother or sister to every other child of God.  Do you accept the invitation? 

> _But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD._  [Joshua 14:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua14:15)


**Questions:**

1. Take inventory of your house.  If you have decorated with crosses or images of Jesus, or you possess a fish or cross necklace….. Are you worshipping these objects, or are they an outward expression of an inner worshipful attitude toward Christ?
2. Who are you praying to?  The saints, Mary, angels…..or to God our Father, in the name of Jesus Christ his son?
