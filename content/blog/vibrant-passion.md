### [Philippians 3][1]

There are many things that we can become passionate about but that passion can be a roller coaster. Passion can lead to disappointment. But our passion for Christ and living for him will not disappoint. Of course we have to remember Paul's words, “Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.” [Phil.‬ ‭3:12‬ ‭NIV][2] We have to be careful to keep our eyes on the prize and not get distracted. 

I was roped into running high hurdles at a track meet because the guy that loved to run them got tangled up and injured by one of the hurdles during practice. He got distracted by his girlfriend in the stands. Despite having never run the hurdles in a meet, I won... well the other three runners all fell down. Two got up and did get their medals. I just had to keep my eyes on the prize, keep plodding along, jumping the best I could over those hurdles, getting banged up a little but I got first prize. 

There are many things that will try to distract us from the prize. We need to have a passion for Christ and living for him. There will be hurdles in our way. They may even trip us up at times. We can let them stop us or we can keep our eyes on Jesus, relying on him to give us the strength and courage and press on to the prize that awaits us. 

> _Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me._ [Revelation‬ ‭22:12][3]‬

2. What can help you stoke your passion for Christ?
