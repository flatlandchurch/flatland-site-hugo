[**2 Timothy 4:9-22**][2tim4]

We were not created to be alone, and we surely cannot be disciples on our own.  Jesus designed his ministry to be a team effort, not only sending his twelve disciples out in pairs ([Mark 6:6-7][mark6]), but also appointing seventy-two others and sending them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go ([Luke 10:1][luke10]). Why did Jesus do this?

Teamwork is powerful. By going in pairs the disciples could support and learn from each other.  The influence and support among those we walk with empowers a more effective discipleship.

The witness of two or more is trustworthy.  One person telling of a miracle they witnessed or experienced is likely doubted.  Two with the same testimony are more likely validated. In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true ([John 8:17][john8]).

Teamwork allows us to draw upon each other’s strengths.  One has the gift of prophesy.  Another, the gift of hospitality.  Still another, the gift of wisdom.  Discipleship is stronger when these gifts are united in teamwork.  Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. ([1 Cor.  12:4-7][1cor12])

The Book of Exodus tells of a powerful teamwork that saved the Israelites.  During a battle with Amalek, Moses was commanded by God to stand on a mountainside and hold his hands upward toward heaven.  As long as he did this, the Israelites would win.  When Moses’ hands grew tired, Aaron and Hur held his hands steady until the Amalekite army was overtaken. ([Exodus 17:12-13][ex17])

> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow -[Ecclesiastes 4:9-10][ecc4]
