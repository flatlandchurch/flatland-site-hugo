_Commit your work to the LORD, and your plans will be established._ [Proverbs 16:3 (ESV)][pro163] When we make plans, we have a couple options; get stubborn and say, "my way or no way" or we can make our plans, turn to the Lord and say, "this is what I think, what do you think?" Now, when we are continually looking to the Lord for direction, we are moving closer to Him. As such, we will more and more find ourselves making plans that are in align with God. We will hear, "Yes my child." Of course, there will always be times when God may say, "Hmm, this is a better way to go, try it."

I like the Hebrew word that the proverb uses which is translated as "established" or "successful". It is a technical building term, it refers to the pillars that hold up a building. The same word is found in [the story of Samson][jud16] at the end of his life; he is blind, defeated and enslaved but his hair has grown out. He asks someone to put his hands on the pillars that holds the building up. He commits his plans to the Lord then pushes them over and the temple falls down taking all his enemies with him in his death. Pillar is the same word for established we find in Proverbs. A building which has these pillars are so strong it takes a supernatural act of Samson to knock it down.

The important part of committing our plans to the Lord is listening to His voice, for those times when He does say, "this is a better way, try it." At that point, we need to change our plans, just like the wise men did after visiting baby Jesus and go a different way. As we follow His voice, as we make our plans in His way, and commit them to Him they will be firmly established; they are held up by the Lord so that they will not fall.

> _Trust in the LORD with all your heart;_
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not depend on your own understanding._
> _Seek his will in all you do,_
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will show you which path to take._
> _Donâ€™t be impressed with your own wisdom._
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, fear the LORD and turn away from evil._
> _Then you will have healing for your body_
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and strength for your bones._
> _Honor the LORD with your wealth_
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the best part of everything you produce._
> _Then he will fill your barns with grain,_
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your vats will overflow with good wine._ -[Proverbs 3:5-10][pro3] (NLT)
