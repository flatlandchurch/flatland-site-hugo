**[Colossians 4:7-18]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians4:7-18)**

I am burdened by many difficulties. They are.... Bleh, who cares? Actually, God cares. (see [1 Peter 5:7]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Peter5:7)) Paul had a tendency to briefly mention his problems but he also constantly would say "my weaknesses make God's work that much more powerful." (see [2 Corinthians 12:9-10]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians12:9-10)) Our difficulties are opportunities for God to do great things. 

Writing these devotionals at times feels like a great difficulty. We also do Bible research for the leadership team and other teams at Flatland. We often struggle over the meaning of Scripture or how to apply it to our lives. **But** we know that when we have a problem **we can rely on the rest of the research team** to help. Difficulties? Be it Biblical questions or a broken garage door opener, we care for each other!

Right now there are only three of us on the team; JJ, Kathie, and me (Bill). Together we are significantly stronger than alone. We need more members to become even stronger but even if there were ten of us, we would still need to rely on God for it is God who provides the knowledge, direction and members on the team. 

We are also a part of a bigger team, Flatland Church. From Flatland we derive strength and in turn we hope to build up the Body. We will continue to have difficulties but we are confident in the Lord that as He leads us as a team we will be able to do the work which He has called us to do.
