[2 Timothy 2:15-26][2tim2]

Disciple is a noun, not a verb. We are disciples and we are commanded by Jesus to go and make more disciples. Discipleship is a lifestyle. Unfortunately, the world presents a lot of other lifestyles that often seem to be more attactive. They don't present lifestyles which the founder of Christian discipleship said His disciples would have, one of servanthood and sometimes hardship, persecution, and for some, death. As Paul wrote to Timothy he was experiencing all those things. But we are also promised a lifestyle [full of joy][1pe18], [peace][peace], [hope][hope] and [love][love]. That is the lifestyle Paul lived despite the circumstances surrounding him and is the lifestyle we are called to have as well.

When we are living the life of a disciple of Christ we will [bear fruit][jhn15], that is, more people will become disciples of Christ. We will exude the [fruit of the Spirit][fruit], "love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control." The Christian lifestyle sounds great until someone starts distracting us with even "better" ways to live while others attack us for our lifestyle and beliefs. Then it is time to focus.

Paul's instruction to Timothy was to "pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace." I picture one of those cop chases on TV where the absolute focus is on the chase and everything around is just a blur. That is the way we must live our lives, keeping our eyes on Christ, pursuing godly things and ignoring anything else. We need to _be_ a disciple, not just call ourselves one.

> _Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith._ -[Hebrews 12:1-2][heb12]
