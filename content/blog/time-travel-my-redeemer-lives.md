> _“I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes – I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!”_ - [Job‬ ‭19:26-27‬ ‭NIV][1]

The book of Job some feel is one of the oldest written books in the Bible. Despite dearth of other references to the resurrection  in the Old Testament, the belief in the resurrection is a very old teaching in Scripture. But by Jesus’ time there is a major debate over the resurrection. The Sadducees didn't have a hope for eternity. But Jesus changed it all.

The resurrection isn't just a wishful hoping, it is a firm foundation belief in the resurrection. Our hope is assured. We need to have the assurance the Job had, one that leads to a yearning for that which we know will happen.

Jesus changed it all. His resurrection seals the deal. Whenever we are confronted with despair, persecution, or pain we can stand with Job and say that no matter what, we shall see Him in the flesh. _**Our Redeemer lives!**_
