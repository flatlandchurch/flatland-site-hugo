**[Colossians 1:1-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1:1-14)**

[1 John 1:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John1:5) tells us that God is light, and in God there is no darkness.  [Proverbs 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs4:19) tells us that the way of the wicked is like deep darkness. There is quite a difference between the way of God and the way of the wicked. [Isaiah 61:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah61:1) proclaims the good news of  freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners [or, the blind]. Jesus says the healthy do not need a physician; the sick do ([Mark 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark2:17), [Matthew 9:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew9:12) and [Luke 5:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke5:31)).

The Colossians were once stumbling and drifting in darkness--they were sick--but they changed when they followed Christ. Their holiness, commitment, faith. and love was recognized early in the epistle (see verses 2-4). The change was inspiring so that Paul prays thankfully for the Colossians and desires to see them continue strong in the Lord and not drift back into the darkness.

That same prayer can be made for each of us. We have been called out of the darkness into the light. Let us strive to not drift but stay strong in the Lord (vs11).

**Questions**
1. Why may darkness be compared to, describe, or symbolize captivity, blindness, and/or sickness?
2. Has there been a time in your life when you realized you needed Jesus, the physician?
3. What does Colossians 1:13-14 say about Christians, related to darkness?
4. What does Colossians 1:12 indicate will be our natural response to the good news, the reality, of Col. 1:13-14?
