Authentic means of undisputed origin; genuine; entitled to acceptance or belief because of agreement with known facts or experience.  Things that are authentic are worth our time because of their integrity.  We trust the food at the authentic Chinese restaurant to be real Chinese food.  We want authentic Levi’s because they are durable.  We count on an authentic birth certificate to prove our identity.

A birth certificate proves your identity, but there is no document that can prove your faith in Christ.  You may list your religion on a form when you’re admitted to the hospital, you may have a baptism certificate from when you were an infant, you may even have a bible with your name engraved on the cover.  But these documents do not prove your agreement with Christ.  The truth of your identity as a Christian is authenticated in your ability to live that truth.  _So never be ashamed to tell others about the Lord_ ([2 Timothy 1:8][1]).  Fear of ridicule, losing friends, being misunderstood can keep us from sharing the gospel.  Do it anyway, and write your own birth certificate – you are a _Child of God_.

>_For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline._ ~[2 Timothy 1:7][2]
