Scripture and science are compatible.

_Say what??_

Many scientist says it took billions of years before humans arrived.  The blinding light caused by the big bang itself lasted 10,00 years.

The Bible says it all happened in seven days.

Compatible??

Given that Moses wrote/compiled the first book of the Bible Genesis, it was done sometime 1400-1200 B.C. (depending on the dating of the exodus).  The concept of time, based on astronomical observations, was developed around 2,000 B.C. so the oral traditions that would have been handed down to Moses would not necessarily even had the concise concepts of time that we have now.

Each day of creation in Genesis ends with “And there was evening, and there was morning—the ____ day.”  We have this ending point to each part of creation, but we are not given a starting point.

We want to take things literally, yet we throw around figurative language on a daily basis.  “Back in the day”, “In this day and age”, “Kids these days” … None of these phrases are referring to a day as a 24-hour period of time. Even today in our precise, down to the millisecond concepts of time we are sloppy with time periods. But we have to take heed to Peter’s warning, “But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.” [2 Peter 3:8][2] When God and time are mixed, as in the creation story, a day for God to create could be billions of years from our perspective.

Perhaps the more important verse to ponder is in the Gospel of John.
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.&hellip; the Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.”  [John 1:1-14][1]

God the Father, God the Son were always there.  Before days.  All days.  Days past and days to come.  Every day.  Before time.  Believe the scientific story, it’s okay.  God was here first.  Nothing else was possible without the eternity which already existed, and the promise of what was and is to come.

> _This is the day the LORD has made;
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will rejoice and be glad in it._  [Psalm 118:24][3]


### Reflection

Eternity past was before creation.  Eternity future will be after God’s final judgement.  In between is time.  This is the day.  Take time to rejoice.
