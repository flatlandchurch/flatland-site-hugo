### [Luke 13:1-5][1]

Habit #2, in Steven Covey’s _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ is:

> _Begin with the end in mind._

This habit is based on the principle that all things are created twice.  First there is a mental creation, which is your vision of who you are and what you want in life.  The physical creation of that vision follows.

Covey asks his readers to envision the eulogy at our own funeral.  What do we want people to say about the life we’ve lived?  With that end in mind, we can work on shaping our life to fulfill that vision.

Covey asks his readers to write a personal mission statement.  He has us take into account:
* Identifying the things that impact our performance
* How we find enjoyment in our personal and professional lives
* How we can use our natural talents and gifts
* Our imagination of the ideal life
* Our vision to impact others
* Our desired character
* The contributions we want to make to others
* What our conscience wants us to work on
* Striving to have the attributes of the influential people in our lives
* Focusing on a state of fulfillment with a balance in the physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional realms

Let’s rewrite this habit on Jesus’s behalf….

> _Live with the end in mind._

This habit is based on the principle that all people are created twice.  First there is a physical creation, when we are born into the world.  The spiritual creation follows when we choose Jesus as the leader and Lord of our life.  We are born again.

Jesus asks us to envision our eternal life with him.  What do we want him to say about the life we’ve lived?  With that end in mind, we can have a relationship with him and strive to live the life God created us for.

Jesus wrote our personal mission statement in the gospel. His mission statement for us takes into account:
* Receiving and giving of grace
* Finding joy, regardless of our circumstances
* Using our God-given talents for his glory
* God’s will for our lives
* Bringing others into God’s kingdom
* Striving for a Christ-like character
* Our contribution to God’s kingdom
* A conscience that is ruled by God
* The influence of the bible
* Seeking fulfillment through God in all realms of our lives

When we live with the end in mind, we can focus on walking with our savior, who will be waiting for us at the end.

> _Show me, LORD, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is... But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you._  [Psalm 39:4, 7][2]
