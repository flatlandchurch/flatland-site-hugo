**[Titus 1][1]**

I heard a phase and a short discussion recently on a podcast that got me thinking, “cultural Christian”. It refers to Christians who are shaped and informed by our culture. They live lives in such a way they blend in perfectly with the world. But we are called to live according to a different standard, the one of Christ. We don’t blend, we stick out, it [gets us into trouble][3].

During [Sunday’s message][flat] Pastor Kelvin displayed what is commonly referred to at Flatland as circle theology. Those who believe in Christ are in the circle, all striving to move closer to the center, moving close to God. Moving to the center entails moving away from the world’s standards, it’s culture. It isn’t easy because the world’s message is so prevalent and way too many of our churches have become cultural Christians too. The choice is clear though, the very term “cultural Christian” is an oxymoron. We can live Christ like or live the culture. It is not easy and it doesn’t happen over night.

The writer to the Hebrews said it this way, “We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you _because you no longer try to understand_. In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again.” [Hebrews 5:11-12 NIV][2] It takes effort to move to the middle, a calling that we all have. We can give up trying and become cultural christians, christians in name only or we can strive to learn and live like Christ. We move to the center and become Christians in word and deed and become spiritual leaders. Let’s move!

> _but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,_    
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who meditates on his law day and night._    
> _That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,_    
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which yields its fruit in season_    
> _and whose leaf does not wither—_   
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever they do prospers._ -[Psalm 1][4]
