**[Colossians 2:4-23]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians2:4-23)**

Ok, I admit it, I mess up sometimes. People who subscribe to the email posts know that for sure after getting 10 repeated emails of the first post for Drifters. I thought I knew what I was doing but obviously not, much to the dismay of those who got inundated by the emails. When I rely on myself and my own understanding I fail. 

Paul says those who get puffed up on their own spiritually have become disconnected from the head, that is Christ, from whom we receive all ability to grow. They think they are spiritual but are not. Weirdly, the way many of us try to be spiritual is to set up a bunch of rules to follow. Those rules become a serious stumbling block (vss 20-23). We think that because we can follow those rules we will be spiritual but instead we fail for they have nothing to do with who Christ is. 

Paul tells us that it is by living in the Spirit, relying on Christ and His strength we will not fail. Instead of drifting all over the place, we become anchored in the Lord. If we think about it, the best way to be spiritual is to rely on the Holy Spirit Himself to provide us with victory instead of struggling on our own. 

**Questions**
1. Paul says in Colossians 2:7 to be rooted in Christ, how do we do that?
2. Why do we fall back on rules and traditions instead of Christ?
3. What can we do today to "live your lives in him" (Colossians 2:6)?
