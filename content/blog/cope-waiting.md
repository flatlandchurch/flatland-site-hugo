Most of us can remember a time when we had to wait more than we do today.  I remember a time when we had to wait for someone to get up off the couch to change the TV channel.  We didn’t just call our relatives who lived far away whenever we felt like it, because that was long distance, so we would send a letter in the mail and wait for them to reply.  Some of you may only go far back enough to remember waiting for the internet to dial up.  Maybe you had to wait for a package to arrive, or wait for someone to answer your email.
Now we’re on the internet instantly, and we can send a message to someone miles, even oceans away and get an instant reply. We can change the channel with the click of a button or even with our voice, we can order what we need and have it delivered to our door tomorrow.

We’ve forgotten how to wait.  But God doesn’t use a smartphone.  We can call on him anytime, but we may not get an instant answer.  We may even have to get up to pray.  And then, wait.  At the right time, God will provide our needs, deliver us, rescue us.

God calls upon us to wait quietly,

> *The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.* ~[Lamentations 3:25-26][1]

to wait eagerly,

> *For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.* ~[Galatians 5:5][2]

and to wait patiently.

> *Be patient, therefore, brothers,until the coming of the Lord. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand*.  ~[James 5:7-8][3]

However, we should not wait to seek Him.  The time is now.

> *But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.* ~[Matthew 6:33][4]
