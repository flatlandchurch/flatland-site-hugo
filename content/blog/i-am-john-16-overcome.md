[**Today’s Reading: John 16 - Overcome**][1]

Jesus has been a [“Debbie Downer”][2] in chapter 16. The disciples are confused, sleepy, and really not sure what is going on. Jesus keeps on talking about things that just don’t make sense. Finally he says something that triggers a response from the disciples, “Now you are speaking clearly” but even their response is clueless. Jesus speaks a sigh but concludes upbeat, “Take heart! I have overcome the world.” He says this knowing just moments from then, he will be arrested, judged and crucified. Trouble is coming, yet he stands confident that he has already overcome because he knows, he is the I AM.

Trouble comes for us too but Jesus’ words to the disciples are just as true for us. Jesus is still the I AM. He has overcome the world and those troubles. We can take heart that although we do go through troubles--that isn’t fun at all--Jesus will be right there with us, helping us, guiding us, encouraging and strengthening us. Trouble may come but we have peace in Jesus, in Him we shall overcome.

> _I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world._ -[John 16:33][3]
