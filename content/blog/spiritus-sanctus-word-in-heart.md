[**Psalm 119:9-16**][psa119]

I occassionally watch a tv show in which the main host can rattle off every Mopar part number for practically every Dodge or Plymoth muscle car built before 1980, not to mention all kinds of silly lines from his favorite movies. Those things are important to him but for most of us, we would rather dedicate our little gray cells to other things. What we take time to memorize, when we spend a lot of time emersed in something to the point of becoming second nature becomes a signature of who we are. So when people look at us, what is our signature?

King David had his signature, "a man after God's own heart". It is a signature that I wish I had. It is a signature I pray that we all desire. How did David become known as a man after God's heart? I think it came down to one simple thing, he spent a lot of time moving to the center. He was constantly pouring over God's Word. He sang that he had memorized it. He also constantly prayed, he spent time and time and half worshiping God, he wrote songs of praise, repentance, and petitions to the Lord Almighty. When he faced Goliath, he bragged he could do it, not because he was strong, powerful, skilled at slaying giants. He bragged he could do it because in previous events in his life when facing certain death, God had rescued him. David faced Goliath because he knew God would rescue him. David walked with God and more importantly, God walked with David.

What is important to you? If moving to the center of God's kingdom is important, then we need to dedicate ourselves to becoming a specialist in God. God's Word should always be on our lips and in our heart. God's Spirit should be moving in our lives as we interact with others. One of the most important actions we can take in our walk with God is to pour over God’s Word; read it, study it, memorize it, pray it. God’s Word is God speaking and revealing Himself to us. It is one of the ways that God tries to establish a firm relationship with us but when we neglect God’s Word, we neglect God. Let us spend time with God and make Him integral to our lives.

> _How can a young person stay on the path of purity?   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By living according to your word.   
> I seek you with all my heart;   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not let me stray from your commands.   
> I have hidden your word in my heart    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I might not sin against you._ -[Psalm 119:9-11][psa119]
