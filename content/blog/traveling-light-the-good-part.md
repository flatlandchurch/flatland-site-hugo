### [Luke 10:38-42][1]

When studying this passage in Luke I followed the good study habit of reading it in several translations. The last line of the passage, verse 42, differs between them a bit so I dug in deeper. The NIV translates it as “Mary has chosen what is better” whereas the NASB translates it, “Mary has chosen the good part" and the NLT “There is only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it."

I discovered that the NASB is closest to the literal translation (which is no surprise) and the NLT completely missed the point. The phrase "good part" can be found in classical Greek legal documents when discussing inheritance, fighting over who got what. They all wanted the "good part". Nobody wants the stinky socks and rusted out gardening tools.

Jesus says that Mary chose the good part implying Martha had chosen the left overs, those stinky socks. Martha probably thought that she was choosing the good part, serving Jesus and his disciples. Martha's goals were honorable. The problem wasn't serving Jesus, the problem was forgetting Jesus altogether concentrating on the serving instead of the one she was serving.

I said the NLT missed the point. Mary didn't "discover" the good stuff, she chose it. This was not an 'ah ha' moment. Mary wanted everything that Jesus could give her so she consciously chose it instead of flitting around doing what Martha wanted. By complaining to Jesus, Martha may have done herself service, getting pulled up short by Jesus’ words. One would hope that at that point she blinked in surprise, sat down by Mary and started listening.

Service is important but our relationship with Christ is primary. Neglecting Christ results in poor results from our service and eventually none at all. Choosing to prioritize Christ first makes our service more effective and less draining on our physical selves as well. The "good part" is always Christ.

> _I will keep my eyes always on the Lord._
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;With him at my right hand, I shall not be shaken._
> _Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices_ [Psalm 16:8-9][2]
