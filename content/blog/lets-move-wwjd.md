[**Titus 3:12-15**][1]

As of Noon on the date of this writing, a share of CMG is valued at 1,880.04. The obvious question is who cares? I mean, most people don’t even know what CMG stand for. However, if you’re one of those who has purchased stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, you’re someone who’s interested in these letters and the numbers associated with them. It’s what’s sometimes referred to as “having skin in the game”. After all, Jesus said “Where your treasure is, there you heart will be also” [(Matthew 6:21)][2].

Our guarantee of salvation is entirely dependent on our knowledge and faith in the fact that Jesus has skin in our personal life. Jesus didn’t just watch us from the comfort of His palace on CTN - the _Celestial Television Network_, He physically came to earth; His mission field. In His missionary work, even before His flesh was torn by nails and spear, Jesus was violently scourged. He didn’t just sacrifice a little skin – He gave all, even to the point of death. He kept absolutely nothing for Himself to purchase a place for you in Heaven.

Have you ever responded to a call into the His mission field? Whether here in the United States or abroad, there is no way to fully appreciate the mission field by watching it form the comfort of our living room on TV. The moment your boots hit the ground you feel the need. The moment you feel the need you’re blessed with a vested interest in your new friends. Any fundraising or personal sacrifice you’ve done to this point is counted as nothing. All that matters is your new friends and doing absolutely everything you can in the time you have with them to meet their needs. And feeding them is only the beginning. They desperately need food and medical care for this life, of course. And they need to hear the Word so that they can receive salvation – forevermore.

Having a sincere love for Jesus compels all of us who dare to desire to be called Christians to have skin in His mission field. Jesus withheld nothing. What are you keeping for yourself today that can bring one more soul into heaven?

> _Do **everything** you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos with their trip. See that they are given everything they need. Our people must learn to do good by meeting the urgent needs of others; then they will not be unproductive._ Titus 3:13-14 NLT
