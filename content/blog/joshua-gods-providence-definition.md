**[Joshua 5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua5-8)**

The dictionary defines providence as follows:
> Noun: 1. The protective care of God or of nature as a spiritual power. 2. God or nature as providing protective or spiritual care.

As we read chapter 6 in Joshua, do we see providence, as it is hereby defined?  Here we see God sending His own messenger to Joshua (5:13-15) with instructions beginning in verse 15 and continuing into the next chapter.  Instructions include Israel carrying the Ark of the Lord (presence of God) around the city of Jericho for seven days.  We see that the Lord has delivered (note the use of the past-tense here) the city into Israel's hands along with all its fighting men up to and including its king.  We see that Israel obeys, following God's commands to the letter and we see the walls fall, just as the Lord has promised.  Now we see Israel conquering the city and destroying everything with the exception of Rahab and her family, as God had specifically granted her His divine providence.

Israel does not come up short, by any means, in the Lord's providence.  Note that Jericho does not go on the offensive.  Jericho does not fire a single shot.  Neither do they negotiate.  Jericho sends not one single representative to negotiate a peaceful agreement.  It seems Jericho has put its faith entirely in human accomplishment (the wall) while Israel puts its faith entirely in the Lord. By faith alone and not by human means does the wall come crashing down, decimating Jericho's morale and elevating the morale of Israel.  Under these conditions, Jericho doesn't stand a chance and they are wiped from the face of the land along with all their livestock. The land is purged, or cleansed, from their evil practices and traditions.  Jericho is to be the first fruits of the promised-land, therefore everything is to be sacrificed to the Lord.

**Questions**

1. Using the definition above, how many instances of God's providence can you count in this period of history?
2. It goes without saying that attacking nations and ethnic purging are not normative events in Christian life.  So, what specific battles are you called into today as a warrior for Christ?  When facing hardship, do you trust in your own ability and accomplishment or do you put your faith entirely in the Lord?
