Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” That dream is being shattered right now. The color of one’s skin seems to be the only thing that matters. The divisions in our world is pronounced to the degree that it feels like there is no answer. 

But... Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also said, “I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.” As a minister he knew that the only way racism would be overcome is through Christ. Christ is the way, the truth, the life. Through Him, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream can become reality, _when we allow Christ to change us._

Oops, yeah, _we are the ones who have to change_. We are the ones that must be filled with love for our friends and neighbors. Without that change our witness for Christ will be nonexistent. When we read the [story of the Good Samaritan][1], we often forget how much hatred existed between Jew and Samaritan.  It was extreme racism. For Jesus to say to the Jews “be like that Samaritan” would have been quite a shock, not to mention the shock they would have felt already that a Samaritan had helped a Jew. But that is the love to which we are called. Only extreme love for others can make our witness valid and effective. Our love for all expresses the love that God has for them and guides the lost to be saved.

> _Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God._-[Ephesians‬ ‭5:1-2‬ ‭NIV][2]
