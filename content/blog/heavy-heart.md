### Know Your Value

Each item that has ever been created has a value that's placed on it by the creator.  What does that mean for our value then?  Do we think we're valuable?  Do we need things to make our lives more valuable?  Why do you think we worry about these things sometimes?  Why are they so important?  Jesus even tells us not to worry about these things in Luke 12:22:

> Then Jesus said to his disciples: â€œTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.

If we're are not focused on the right things, we'll miss them.  Jesus has all the resources we'll ever need readily available every single day.  He sees us exactly where we're at but still expects us to try and focus on Him through everything.  He's the only one that knows the plan for our lives.  We also have to remember that God sent Jesus to die on the cross for us because He knows our worth.  He believes that we are that much.


### Know Your Purpose

Once we know our worth, it's vital that we determine what our purpose in life should be.  There are a lot of times when we could lose focus and balance within our lives.  While we may all have more specific purposes for our lives, there is one thing we all have in common.  We are all responsible for inviting people into the Kingdom of God.  It's essential we provide opportunities and allow God to work through our lives so that more people can experience His love.

If you've attended a Flatland service, we focus on our Circle Theology.  We believe the Kingdom of God is like a big circle.  To enter the circle and become closer to God, we have to have Faith in Jesus.  Our faith is what allows us to join the circle.  As we continue on our walk, we are trying to move closer to the center because it moves us closer to God.  The Holy Spirit helps us move closer while sin tries to push us away.  It's is an ongoing journey, and it doesn't end until we die.  We always have to try to move closer to the center to move closer to what God has in store for us.  If we can help more people move to the center, it would allow us to fulfill one of our highest callings.


### Know Your Heart

> Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ~Luke 12:33-34

Willingness to give up everything to follow Jesus is, and it's the little actions that will make us heroes.  The little things are what make us real heroes.  

>When we put out treasures of heaven, we'll want more of it every day. ~Pastor Kelvin Nygren

The best part of wanting more treasures of heaven is that God is willing to give them to us.  He'll continue to bless us through the high and low points of our lives.  So, it's time to trust in Him, move to the center and invite other people along the way.  We will never reach our goals if we don't make this a priority.


### Weekly Challenge Verse

*Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life. ~1 Timothy 6:18
