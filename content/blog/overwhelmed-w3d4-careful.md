#### [Luke 12:16-21][1]

Do you have times in your life when you experience contentment in planning out intricate details of something you want to do or accomplish? In this parable, Jesus illustrates the age-old problem of following our own plans without regard for what God has planned for our life. In this case, the man becomes overwhelmed by death right in the middle of his planning process. As a result, no one benefits. While on the on one hand [he had no worries, which is good,][2] but on the other hand, his plan totally crashed and burned when it collided with God’s.

God’s plans are perfect and, as such, will not only come to full fruition, but will always win out. When we don’t align with God’s perfect will, we’re destined to collide with it at some point. Whether you’re overwhelmed now because your best laid plans are collapsing around you, or you’re still proceeding merrily along, this is the perfect time to talk them over with God. And coming to Him in humility is the key.

Beginning in the knowledge that we’re only human is essential to having a conversation with the Almighty Creator of the universe. And, to help us in approaching, listening, yielding and obeying His perfect plan requires discipline on our part. Human efforts will yield human results, but only Spiritual disciplines can yield Spiritual results. Daily practice of reading and actually meditating on what God says in the Bible and applying it to our day is absolutely essential. Additional disciplines like prayer and fasting lead us into a direct communication link with our heavenly Father. In this way, we can develop the ability to hear that still small voice of His and walk alongside Him instead of becoming overwhelmed in colliding with Him.

### Challenges
- What plans are you currently considering? Are you making plans and asking God to bless them or are you asking God to bless you with the knowledge of His plans?
- Which Spiritual disciplines are you practicing on a regular basis? Which are you practicing on a daily basis? How does this contribute to your ability to hear the voice of God and walk in the comfort of absolute peace with him in your presence?
