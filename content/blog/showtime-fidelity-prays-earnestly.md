#### [James 5:13-18][james]

In our homes we have a lot of light bulbs but they have to have the light switch flipped on to shine brightly. The power is there all the time, sitting in our walls but is ineffectual until that light switch is turned on. Then, and only then, will the bulb shine.

That light switch is prayer. When a believer prays and believes, we have a direct connection to God. James 5:16 says, “The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results.” (NLT) That sentence in Greek consists of only 5 words, in order; much, power, (with) prayer, (the) righteous, energizes. Or, as I was implying, “the prayer of a righteous person flips the switch so power will flow”.

James gives the example of Elijah, who “was a person just like us”. He prayed earnestly and it didn’t rain. Then he prayed and it did rain. Hmm, have to emphasize that phrase, “was a person, _just like us_.” The message is clear, as we serve God (fidelity) we can have confidence (be earnest) to flip the switch through prayer and see amazing, powerful things (with the warning James mentions in 4:3). Yep, people just like us.

### Reflection
- What is it that keeps you from praying earnestly and seeing results that are powerful and effective?

> _“Have faith in God,” Jesus answered. “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”_ -Mark 11:22-24
