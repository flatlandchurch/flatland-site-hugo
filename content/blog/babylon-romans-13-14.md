**[Romans 13-14][1]**

Today’s reading often causes consternation. Paul says to obey our government yet there are times when the government is absolutely wrong (e.g., Nazi Germany). At those times, we have to take a clue from the apostles statement that we see in [Acts 5][acts] where “We must obey God rather than human beings!” The issue comes down to the choice between obeying God and obeying man. If that choice doesn’t exist, then obeying our government is our only choice, even when we don’t like the rule.

For example, we might feel that we should be allowed to drive 95mph down Interstate 80. Tough, we must obey the laws and follow the speed limit. On the other hand, when we are confronted with the choice to speak the truth about the Good News or back off and [hide under cover][matt], we must let our light shine. In both instances, obeying the law of the land and obeying God, the Gospel will be preached out of our lives.

Paul reminds us that we must live according to Christ’s standard because He is coming soon. We have a dual citizenship, one here on earth which is very temporary and one that is eternal. Our lives as citizens here on earth will have an impact on others here on earth which will have eternal consequences. We don’t have a lot of time, He is coming soon, our citizenship in heaven will become reality, so lets live like it now - Let’s Move!
