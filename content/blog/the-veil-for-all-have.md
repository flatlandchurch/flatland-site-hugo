### [Romans 3:22-24][1]
Paul writes a major indictment against us, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” [Romans‬ ‭3:23][1]‬. He also says “the wages of sin is death” [Romans‬ ‭6:23][2]‬. ‭‬There is a spiritual veil that separates us from God. It is there to protect us. We are filthy and to enter in to his presence is to ask for death. But Paul doesn't leave us apart from God. He continues, “and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.” [Romans‬ ‭3:24][1]‬ ‭‬‬ and later “the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” [Romans‬ ‭6:23‬‬‬][2]

One of the most overlooked scripture is a brief line in the Gospels, “The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.”
‭‭[Mark‬ ‭15:38][3]‬‬‬ It is a visual aid God provided us indicating a major shift in the relationship that God has with mankind. Before Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross God was unapproachable because of our sin but Jesus changed all that. A way has opened through Christ for all to [enter into His presence][4].

We hope this series regarding the veil will help tear open anything blocking you from God. God is holy, he is mighty, he is awesome. He is unapproachable without Christ. But as we study all the imagery surrounding the veil, we should come to understand better who God is, why we cannot approach him without Jesus but also because of what Jesus did we have the privilege to do something that is impossible.

> “Come near to God and he will come near to you.”‭‭ -[James‬ ‭4:8][5]‬
