**[Colossians 3:17-4:6]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians3:17-4:6)**

How often do you work for a reward?  Whether it be money, recognition, status, love… these are earthly rewards.  When we think of inheritance we think of what we will get when a loved one passes… their house, life insurance, money.  When we don't get what we expect to inherit, dissatisfaction can creep in and even when we do, is it ever enough?

I once knew of a woman who was single, had no children, and was well off financially.  The husband of her niece did repairs for her frequently, with no pay, with the promise that he would be in her will.  When she entered into a nursing home for her final years, her great-nieces, daughters of the husband, who were never close to her, suddenly took an interest in visiting her; openly admitting to others that they wanted to get in her good graces so they would be part of the inheritance.  The husband meanwhile divorced the niece, and complained incessantly when the woman passed and he didn’t get his due reward.  The great-nieces received their inheritance and shared with their father, who took the money but continued to complain that he was cheated, until his dying day.  

The father and his daughters missed the boat… the boat that carries the inheritance of the Lord.  Don’t miss out on this precious cargo, for it will make you far richer than the savings of an old woman whom you served without your heart. 

**Questions** 
1. What earthly inheritances are in your boat?  Are you serving others for the cargo in that boat?  
2. What if you had to choose one boat or the other?  Could you give up your earthly inheritance, in order to receive the inheritance of the Lord?
