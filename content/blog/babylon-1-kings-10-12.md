**[1 Kings 10-12][1]**

King Solomon may be the “greatest” king of all time. His wisdom, wealth, and power is incomparable. Unfortunately, Solomon was also incomparable when it came to wives which included many from countries not of Israel. Most likely these wives were in part marriages of convienence, political arrangements, maybe even “gifts” from kings in subservience to Solomon. But God had explicitly told his people not to intermarry with foreigners, specifically “because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.” God knows.

All too often we are presented with choices of convience, choices that the world “gifts” us that seem innocent. Admiral Ackbar said it best, “It’s a trap!” The more we get married to the world, even the innocent things, the farther we move from God, even just a little. We find ourselves in the same position as Solomon, where it could be said of us, our hearts are “not fully devoted to the Lord... So (insert your name here) did evil in the eyes of the Lord; (insert your name here) did not follow the Lord completely.”

Babylon may seem a far off but when we allow just a little bit of the world to slip in (see [2 Kings 20:12ff][2]), the next thing we know, we are being carted off into captivity. If a man of great wisdom can be tripped up by the bling of the world, how much more will we. It is so important to constantly strive to move the center of God’s kingdom; reading the Bible, prayer, fasting, and all the other spiritual practices can help. Mentoring, coaching, life groups, and getting involved in ministry are also big helps. As we move to the center, we flee from the rebellion that is just there waiting to trip us up.

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or stand in the way that sinners take
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or sit in the company of mockers,
> but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who meditates on his law day and night.
> That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which yields its fruit in season
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose leaf does not wither –
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever they do prospers._‭‭-[Psalms‬ ‭1:1-3‬ ‭NIV][3]
