[**2 Samuel 11-12**][1]

David has consistently shown disregard for his personal safety and comfort in serving the Lord.  He stands on the front line when lion and bear attack his flock.  He stands on the front line when asked to deliver supplies to his brothers at war. And he stands on the front line against Goliath.  Doing everything for the Lord, without regard to potential cost is why the Lord “hired” him for position of king.  Now, in this home of influence, David wreaks havoc.  The damage to his home begins when David decides to rest on his laurels.  After all, he’s done a lot of great things – isn’t a lot enough?

David sends his troops to war instead of standing with them. David isn’t where he’s supposed to be and the dominoes fall from there. Because he’s not doing what he’s supposed to do, he sees something he was never supposed to see and he does something he was never supposed to do.  Because David trashed his own home, his family will be a hot mess.  But, in this mess there is grace when David confesses and repents.  While the penalty for adultery is death and the penalty for murder is death, God will transfer the penalty of David’s sin to his innocent son, born to Bathsheba.  The good news is that the child is rescued from a life mixed up in this mess to a life in Heaven.  And the great news is that another [innocent descendant of David][2] will also die and pay the cost for all of our filthy sins.  God takes ashes and makes diamonds.

Accepting help when our home is damaged by storm or other means is one thing. Asking for help when we trash our own home is another.  We’re embarrassed and ashamed.  As a result, we may just lock up that part of our house and never let people in.  We would rather live with brokenness than be transparent and accept the help we need.  David could have denied, minimized, excused or locked his brokenness up in a variety of ways. But transparency led him to confession and repentance.  Because of [the choice he made,][3] the Lord forgave him completely.  Since we know how a perfect God treats sinners who confess and repent, do we have any reason to believe God has changed?  If shame is a disabling factor in your transparency with the people God wants you to influence, place your confidence in the Lord.  Confess your sins to God and repent of them and you will be completely cleansed and liberated from shame.
