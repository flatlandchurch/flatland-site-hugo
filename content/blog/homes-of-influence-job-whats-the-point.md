[**Hebrews 6:10**][heb6]

How often have you worked hard on a project, gone the extra mile for a friend, given 120% in your work, and received no recognition?  How many times have you remained faithful during hardships, trusting in God’s promise?

It can be hard to stay motivated to do your best when your best goes unnoticed or unappreciated, or to remain faithful in the midst of suffering.  We are told we should not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up ([Galatians 6:9][gal69]), that after suffering for a little while, God will restore, support, and strengthen us, and place us on a firm foundation ([1 Peter 5:10][1pe510]).  But what’s the point in doing good if no one notices, or enduring suffering when we see no restoration in sight?

It can be easy during these times to fall away into doubt or disobedience.  Everyone wants their good work to be noticed, and no one wants to suffer.  But we must hold to the promise made when Jesus suffered on the cross.  Make no mistake; you are noticed, and you will be restored by God. By staying faithful, God _will_ make our homes of influence.

> _For God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers, as you still do._ ~[Hebrews 6:10][heb6]
