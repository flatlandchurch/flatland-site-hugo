A legacy is something transmitted by or received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past.  Oftentimes the legacies we carry from our family are passed on through oral tradition.  We can read stories about one-room schoolhouses and life before electricity, but those stories carry so much more meaning for those of us lucky enough to have had a grandparent to tell us their personal story.  We carry that legacy with us, but it gets lost unless we pass it on to our children.  If our children are inspired by the stories we received from our grandparents, the legacy will stay alive and continue to be passed on.

As Christians we carry the legacy of the Gospel in our hearts.  Itâ€™s too precious to keep to ourselves, we know we need to share it.  But we also need to inspire those with whom we share to keep it alive.  Make disciples for Christ, but make disciples who are not just followers, they are also disciple makers.

>_I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also._ ~[2 Timothy 1:5][1]
