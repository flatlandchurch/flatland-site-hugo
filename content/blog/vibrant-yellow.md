Technology has presented society with some of the coolest gadgets hatched from the human mind.  From gaming systems to smartphones to robotic house cleaners, we could say we have the good life (we are in Nebraska after all…wink wink).  So if we have this so-called “good life,” why are we still unhappy?  If we had everything including a huge mansion, fancy cars, and the best food, we would probably still be missing ‘something.’

So the question becomes “What is the something I am missing?”  We typically think it’s something else material that we’re missing, but those tend to continue stealing our joy.  It can fuel our continued desire to purchase more things to make ourselves feel better.  It can also lead us into a vicious circle of trying to impress others.

**Don’t Try to Impress Others**

Why do we have this underlying desire to continue to impress other people around us and make them think that we believe we are better than them?  No matter what we do, we’ll never be better than them, and they’ll never be better than us.  It's imperative to remember, and it even ties in with the name of Flatland.  At Flatland Church, we believe that everyone is on the same level.  No matter if you’re beginning your walk with God or you’ve been walking with him for decades, we’re all the equals.


**Think of Others As Better Than Yourself**

Thinking of everyone as equals is very important and should be a priority.  In Philippians 2, Paul encourages the church to compare ourselves to God to realize that we don't matter compared to another person.  It helps us think of each other as a whole rather than different individuals.  If we are to be the body of Christ, we must remember to have the mentality of humility. Paul knew that we all had to be on the same level to be more influential in the world.

> Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.  ~Philippians 2: 1-4

Another person that comes to mind when thinking about humility is Nelson Mandela.  He was the first democratically elected President of South Africa.  Pastor Rob told us a story about President Mandela and the humility he once showed to an average person who did have any social status.  To start their meeting right, Nelson was waiting in the driveway to greet his guest.  There he welcomed him to his open and opened it up so they could eat lunch in each others company.  Once they were inside and were about ready to eat, Nelson asked his guest where his driver was.  When his guest answered that he was outside waiting, Nelson got up and went to the driver without a word.  He invited the driver in to have breakfast.  Nelson displayed that no matter if you’re the President of South Africa or if you’re the driver of his guest, you’re in equal standing with the President.  We need to be more like President Mandela and not miss out on loving others who we think are ‘lower’ than us.  Regardless of where everyone is at in life, we can learn something from each other.


**Have the Same Attitude Christ Had**

What was Christ’s attitude towards people? Well, we can read about it in the Bible of course but what does that look like out in the world?  It comes down to exactly what Nelson Mandela did; however, there’s more beyond this one act.  When we have the same attitude as Christ, we also have to be willing to say no.

> "If you don’t have boundaries, you will lose the love in your heart.” ~Rob Yanike

There were many times when Jesus said no.  While He knew He would make the ultimate sacrifice, there were times when He had to tell people that they wouldn’t get what they want.  God often reminds us of this as well.  Remember this?

> “When one door closes, another opens.” ~Alexander Graham Bell

This iconic saying may be overused, but it’s true.  God has a plan for us and knows where we need to be at what time.  Now, does this knowledge make following Him any easier?  Of course not!  We have human desires, and the things of this world are fun.  If we make sure that we always listen, we can have confidence that we’ll come to the place where He wants us most.  We merely have to be willing to follow Him.
