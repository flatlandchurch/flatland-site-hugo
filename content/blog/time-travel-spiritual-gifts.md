How do we know what our spiritual gifts are?  We can take a spiritual gifts test, we can wait for someone to ask us to serve.  But the best way to truly discover our spiritual gifts is to use them.  As we use our gifts to serve, we start to notice which gifts we are most passionate about using, which are most effective, and in which God works through us most clearly.  

A natural talent, such as music, may or may not be a spiritual gift.  Perhaps you may play a musical instrument, but God is not calling you to serve on the worship team.  Perhaps, even though you’re not a parent and have never worked with children, he is calling you to work in children’s ministry.  According to [Ephesians 1:22-23][1],
> God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

In order to carry on Christ’s work in the church, it is essential that each believer use the gifts bestowed upon us by the Holy Spirit.  By using our gifts and discovering his plan for their use, we our helping the church execute his mission on earth.

> _Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you._ -[1 Timothy 4:14][2]

**Your task:**  Ask God for his calling upon your heart and what gifts he has given you to fulfill your part in the body of Christ.  If you are not serving in any capacity, take a chance on finding out if the gift you pray about is to be used for His glory.
