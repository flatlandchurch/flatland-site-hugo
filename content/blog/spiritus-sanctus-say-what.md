[**1 Corinthians 2:6-16**][1]

Ok, now that I’ve been introduced to the Holy Spirit, I understand He is actually a real living person with His own unique personality and characteristics and that He loves me dearly. And, even though I still can’t fully wrap my mind around the the Trinity, I accept that if I **_could_** completely understand God, I would have a very small God. But I don’t.

Now, since the Holy Spirit, like the Father and the Son, is fully God, and since I already have the Father and the Son, why do I need the Holy Spirit?

First of all, consider having a friend with a heart and lungs, but no brain. Obviously, we need all individual organs, united  and functioning as one person to have a friend. This may be a rather weak analogy, but my point is we need the whole of God to have a relationship with God. The Trinity - unique persons, yet one indivisible - is who our God is.

And, perhaps the greatest reason we need the Holy Spirit is because even when we’re handed the most significant revelations from God and from Jesus, these messages are as gibberish to us when we don’t have the Holy Spirit to know and show us the meaning. Jesus sent His Holy Spirit as a gift to us. Let’s move into His presence to know, embrace, and fully appreciate the Holy Spirit for our own good.

> _The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit._ 1 Corinthians 2:14 NIV

> _God has shown these things to us through His Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit Who looks into all things, even the secrets of God, and shows them to us. Who can know the things about a man, except a man’s own spirit that is in him? It is the same with God. Who can understand Him except the Holy Spirit?_ 1 Corinthians 2:10-11 NLV
