**[Colossians 3:1-16]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians3:1-16)**

In [Luke 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke15), we have the parable of the lost son who spends his father’s money on loose living, ending up destitute, wearing rags and slopping swine, before coming to his senses and returning to his father.  Upon catching a glimpse of his son in the distance, the father runs to him.  The father, of course represents God our Father, and the only time we ever see Him run is when He’s running to us.  Although not specifically stated, the father has his son completely cleaned up, from the removal of his rags to the smell of his body, thus removing everything from his former life.  The father then clothes his son in the finest robe with sandals on his feet, and of course the signet ring which symbolizes fraternity, as one belonging to the family.  This once dead son is restored to life and royal status.

Our Father wants to do the same for each of us today.  He wants the decrepit “garments” of our old life removed and burned (Col 3:5-9).  He wants us cleaned up from the very “smell” of dirty living so that He may clothe us in royal garments and present us as princes and princesses in His Kingdom here on earth.  The Japanese tradition of layering on a variety of fine ornate linens for special ceremonial occasions can be used to help describe how we are now to “layer” or “clothe” ourselves (Col 3:12) with the fine royal garments of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience or “longsuffering” including forgiveness for any and all grievances just as we have been so forgiven.  And, as the Japanese obi (sash/belt) binds the layers of fine linens together and keeps them from falling off and leaving one completely unclothed again, we are to put on the “obi” of love (v14).

**Questions**
1. Once restored to our royal status, what can entice us to “return to the swine”?  For example; can bearing in love with someone who’s unlovely toward us be easier at first but become harder in the long run?
2. Which is the most important piece of the traditional Japanese dress?  Which is/are the greatest commandment/s?
