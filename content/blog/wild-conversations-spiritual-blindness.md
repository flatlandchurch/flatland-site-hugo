[**Acts 13:4-12**][acts13]

It’s no secret that the world is getting further from the truth and falling into deeper and deeper darkness. This really is not that surprising, considering each year the amount of people who identify as Christian declines, and the amount of people who say they have no religious affiliation rapidly increases. Spiritual blindness affects the increasing number of unbelievers, as well as self-proclaimed Christians who continually choose disobey God and serve themselves. Satan works tirelessly to blind and deceive Christians with false philosophy, false ministers, false doctrine, false disciples, and false morals. Satan delights in taking truth and twisting it ever so subtly, that one might think they are living in truth, but they are not. It is extremely easy to fall victim to Satan’s schemes when we, as humans, start to live separate from God and start relying on ourselves.

Graciously, God presents a way for us to see. Left to our own devices, humans are spiritually blind and without hope. But Jesus is the light of the world and He can open our eyes to see ([John 8:12][jhn812]). Jesus shows us by example how to keep from being blinded by Satan’s schemes. When tempted in the desert, He could have said anything back to Satan and it would have become Scripture (He was just that good!), but instead Jesus quoted Scripture to respond to each of Satan’s temptations ([Luke 4:1-13][luk4]). He shows us just how important it is to know the Word of God. More so, we need to put on the full armor of God ([Ephesians 6:10–17][eph6]). The armor of God will help us take our stand against the devil’s schemes.

Studying and learning as much as you can about the Word of God is wonderful, but God doesn’t want us to stop there. He wants us to go out and proclaim the Good News! You see, Satan is completely fine with a Christian self-centered pursuit of holiness…that is absolutely no threat to his kingdom of darkness. God wants His church to step up and help everyone understand that He loves each and every one of them, and He has a better way. He loves everyone so much and He wants everybody to be set free from the things that are holding them back and binding them down. So let’s remind everyone of the Good News and reflect Christ’s light all over this broken world!
