#### [John 3:16][1]

_“For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”_ John 3:16 is one scripture we can recite by heart because we see it everywhere from readings in churches to placards at sporting events. But have we understood it’s significance well enough to know that it applies to us?

Let’s break this single verse down.

* God loves you. Think of it. The most powerful, challenging and rewarding experience is available to humankind; intimate relationship with the infinite Creator of the universe – forever and ever.
* He loves you so much that He gave His one and only Son to leave a perfect heaven and come down to a messed-up earth and suffer violently at the hands of the very ones He loves.
* Of course, there had to be an extremely critical reason for this act of obedience on the part of His Son, Jesus. That reason being so we would not perish, but enjoy our everlasting life in His presence, as opposed to spending eternity elsewhere.
* Apart from His act of obedience, spending our eternity in heaven would be impossible because, obviously, [if there were any other way for us to be saved,][2] this particular act of obedience would not be necessary.

The problem Jesus solves perfectly is the problem of sin. Sin separates us from the perfection required to enter the presence of a perfect God. And, throughout all of our failing, God’s love for us remains perfectly intact. [This unfailing and unblemished love for you is proven][3] in Jesus’ willingness to suffer instead of seeing you suffer. He took the [penalty of sin][4] that we truly deserve and placed it on His own perfect shoulders. He then [served out our death sentence in our place,][6] and He completely expunges our record.

This is the love of God each of us needs to apply to ourselves personally. In the awareness, understanding and embracing of His unconditional love for us, we’re empowered, enabled, and blessed with a genuine and compelling desire to go out every day into a messed-up world and love people unconditionally. And this is, at its very essence, applying the two great commandments to ourselves – [Love God, and love people.][5]

### Reflections
- Have you ever taken a course in education with no intention of applying what you’ve learned? Can you think of any value of information void of its application?
- If you find yourself holding love back from certain individuals, do you honestly believe you’re applying the love that God has _for_ you _to_ yourself?
