[Philippians 4:6-23][1]

Worry robs us of our joy. It’s impossible to live simultaneously with worry and joy.  Jesus, who wants us to have joy (sometimes even more than we do ourselves) actually commands us not to worry and gives us good reason for this directive. [Matthew 6:25-34][2], gives us several examples. Therefore, worry, at its core, comes down to a lack of faith in Jesus who would never tell us to do anything and then make it impossible for us to do it. A 4-year old in a big room filled with darkness finds comfort in a small night light because when he or she focuses on the light, the darkness – and the worry thereof – slips from their minds.

Paul says he has learned the secret to being content without any regard whatsoever to circumstances (v 12).  Like a magic trick your uncle may have taught you, what was previously impossible for you now becomes possible.  Paul is taking us backstage to reveal the secret to exterminating worry; focusing on the light (v 8).  And, like anything else we learn, from a simple magic trick to sports to music, the learning is the key which unlocks the mystery. But it is only the beginning.  Consider an athlete who learns the game, or a musician who learns the chords, but they don’t practice.  Anyone who knows Paul knows that this is one guy who really practices what he preaches.  And in verse 9 he encourages us to do so as well.  For, unless we practice what we learn from him, his teaching, as great as it is, yields no benefit for us.

### Questions
1. Did you think that living a life free of worry was impossible for you?  Have you reevaluated that thought in light of this teaching?
2. Are you smarter than a 4-year old? Can you focus on the light and let the darkness slip from your mind, even for a minute?  How many joy-filled, worry-free minutes will you be up to this time next week if you keep practicing?
