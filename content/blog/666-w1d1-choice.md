#### [Revelation 13:18][1]
I have to admit to feeling quite inadequate writing anything after hearing [Pastor Bart’s message][2] Sunday titled “The Number of the Beast”. It was one of the best sermons I have heard regarding the subject and I have heard a lot of sermons over the past 60 years regarding Revelation, the beast and 666. We at [Flatland Church][3] are privileged to have a wealth of great pastors who teach and encourage us.

I was struck by the description of the difference between the mark of the beast which is a mark of slavery and the seal placed on believers by Jesus, a seal to guarantee salvation. It has to be said loud and clear, _there is no other choice_. We choose to serve God or we choose to serve the evil one. We choose to be sealed by Christ’s blood or we get marked as a slave of the anti-christ.

Satan offers us a lot, it would appear that he will give us everything including an easy life. Serving Christ on the other hand appears to offer us persecution and even death. _But_ it is so important to understand that both outcomes are _temporary_. Eternally, everything gets swapped, slavery to the beast and eternal suffering or an inheritance from being a child of God, eternal life without suffering or pain. The path is clear, choose Christ, let’s move!

### Challenge
Listen to the sermon (again) and ask yourself as you hear God’s message to us, “Where does my allegiance lie? Do I want to be marked (enslaved) by the beast or do I want to be sealed (protected) by the Lord?”
