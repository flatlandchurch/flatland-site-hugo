#### [Revelation 1:10-19][rev1]

It hit me while [listening to the message][fl] this week that *we* are the light in contrast to the allure that the beast presents. What in the world are we doing chasing after that lure the devil dangles in front of us? We have already arrived, what are we chasing? Pastor said it, “More!” But what does that get us? Anxiety over not having “more”, fear that we may not be able to get “more”, restlessness because we think that we are missing out on “more.” All the while, *those who believe in Christ already have it all!*

We should be the light that draws others to Christ but if we are chasing after “more”, then the world will not see us any different, less alluring than what the beast offers. We will fail in our calling to be the light. This applies to both the church as a whole and each of us as individuals. We need to exhibit the marks of the church as found (sometimes seen as lacking) in Revelation; enduring love (Ephesus, oops), faithful despite suffering (Smyrna, excellent), hold fast to the truth of the Gospel (Pergamum, most), holiness (Thyatira tolerated immorality, oops), alive in Christ (Sardis wasn’t), endurance despite persecution (Phiadelphia, excellent), and fully committed (Laodicea wasn’t).

The light we shine must be the light of Christ, pure and holy. It isn’t coincidental that Jesus’ command to have our light shine comes immediately after the [Beatitudes][be]. “Blessed are you when...” shows us what our light should look like. I notice in the Beatitudes that Jesus never said, “Blessed are you who have attained more!” Rather, he indicates that those that have their eyes fixed on “more” invariably has the light in us darkened.  Striving for “more” kills off our light. [“Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life...”][worry], Jesus says. Then, our light will shine.

> *You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.* -Matthew 5:14-16
