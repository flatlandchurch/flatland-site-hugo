[Romans 12:2][rom12]

I heard there was a devout athiest who had memorized the Bible. It seemed strange to me at the time that anyone could spend so much time memorizing the Bible without it affecting him. But then I thought of all those people who memorize all the stats of a sports team or player. That memorization doesn't make them a good player either, even if they are avid fans of the sport. Sometimes we learn stuff but it just rattles around in our heads and never changes us. I could have the whole Bible memorized but if I don't allow God to move within me to turn those words into a changed life, the words and all the effort to memorize them are empty.

Paul [writing to Timothy][2tim3] reminds him “how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.” It points out that it takes a mixture of faith _and_ knowledge for Scripture to make us wise. As we approach Scripture, we need to do more than just read it, even more than study it. We need to allow God to change us based on what we have read and studied.

Paul wrote in [Romans 8][rom8] how our minds must be governed by the Holy Spirit. When we live by the Holy Spirit, under God’s direction, everything we have read and studied becomes alive and changes us. I love what Paul said, “The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.” Living by faith makes all the difference when it comes to Scripture. That is when our minds and lives are changed. As we read the Bible and study it, the Spirit will move in us confirming the love that God has for us, His children.

### Reflections
* What is the difference between a sports fan who memorizes stats and the players who actually play the sport? How does that compare to reading the Bible and living the Bible?
* What does it look like to have one’s mind changed?
