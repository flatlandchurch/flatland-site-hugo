#### [Revelation 4-5][rev4]
I had a music professor in college who always talked about the Imago Dei which is Latin for image of God. It refers to [Genesis 1:27][gen1], “So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.” Dr. J taught us that everything that we are and do should reflect that image including of course the music that we play and sing. The fall of man shattered that image in us, much as a mirror would be shattered if dropped from 100 feet up. As Christ transforms our lives restoring the image in us everything we do will reflect that image. Yes, the “mirror” is still broken in us but Christ heals the brokenness in us.

The problem, all too often we worship at the wrong throne. We strive to be safe, happy, entertained, powerful, and wealthy among others. We seek to fix the image in us by our own power and abilities. We bow to the throne of Satan thinking that will fix us when in fact, he wants only to shatter the image of God even more in us. For us to shine out, showing the world the image of God in us is terrifying to Satan. When we worship at the throne of Christ the healing comes and His image in us becomes clearer so that others might know Him.

[Pastor Bart said][fla], “You will always worship the thing you want to be.” If we want to be like Jesus, [everything we do][col3] should be in worship of Him. [Paul told the Romans][rom12] “Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” Worship (offering ourselves as sacrifices) at the throne of God will transform us, heal our broken images, and make us shinning lights to the world.

### Challenge
What is your greatest desire other than worship of Christ? Can you put it down at the feet of the throne, sacrificing that desire to God? Will you?
