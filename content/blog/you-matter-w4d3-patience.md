#### [1 Corinthians 13][1]

Love is patient. Back when I was 3 years old, my oldest brother (10 years my senior) taught me to skate. At this point in my life, I can’t remember how many times I slipped and fell before I could even stand on my own, let alone move from one place to another. But I get what I think is a glimpse of it as I watch people give it a go during public ice-skating sessions. I think about the patience my brother must have exercised, as he could have been having so much fun enjoying his own ability to skate around. But he stayed by my side, encouraging me constantly, and never ever making me feel ashamed.

[Love is sacrificial][2] – the exact opposite of serving self. Anyone with the least familiarity of Jesus Christ knows His whole life on earth was about serving others. He performed many miracles for the benefit of others (benevolence). And, while He could have performed miracles for His own benefit, not once did He do so. Oh sure, He got angry. But He never got angry with the inexperienced or uneducated. Jesus’ anger was always directed toward [those who had a thorough knowledge of God’s ways,][3] but pridefully dismissed them, disrespecting His Father. Even so, Jesus sacrificed His life for the benefit of the whole world, so that we can have a restored relationship with His Father.

In the ups and downs, and the give and take of relationships with the world, we know we’re really loving others in our benevolence toward them. We’re more than interested in their salvation, we’re actively and enthusiastically involved in their process, never failing in our patience with them, no matter how many times they slip and fall before they can even stand, let alone move.

While not mentioning scripture at the time, my brother modeled 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. He was kind, he didn’t boast, he didn’t dishonor me, he didn’t seek his own entertainment, he was never angry, he kept no record of my failings, he protected me, hoped for me and he never left me throughout my entire messy process.

### Challenges
- How many times have you slipped and fallen into the same sin? How does Jesus’ patience comfort you in these dark times?
- How many times have people repeated the same sins against you?
- How do you feel knowing that, as someone who has been saved, we can no longer claim to be inexperienced or uneducated?

> _Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no account of wrongs. Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails._ 1 Corinthians 13:4-8a BSB
