Conditional promises...we make them and we receive them all the time.  Your employer promises to pay you, with the condition that you show up for work and do the job.   Your son has a baseball game scheduled, with the condition that it doesn’t rain.  You enter into a contract to purchase a home, with the condition that the current owner makes repairs before the transaction.  You promise your child ice cream, with the condition that he first clean his room.  

In Genesis 12, God makes a promise to Abram: 

> _“I will make you into a great nation,
    and I will bless you;
I will make your name great,
    and you will be a blessing.
I will bless those who bless you,
    and whoever curses you I will curse;
and all peoples on earth
    will be blessed through you.”_  -[Genesis 12: 2-3][1]
 
God stated only one condition preceding this promise to Abram:
 
The Lord had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you.  -[Genesis 12:1][2]
 
God's promises are not dependent on Abram's actions, or obedience, or goodness, or worthiness. God simply says He will do these things to and through Abram.  The only condition is that he must go.

God made a similar promise to all of us when he sent Jesus to live and die as one of us. Because of his sacrifice, we have a promise of redemption and salvation.  The only condition is that we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior, that we walk with him, that we follow him.  We must go. 

Conditions, although sometimes burdensome, can be necessary.  We can’t get paid for a job we don’t do, any more than we would play baseball in a thunderstorm.  God’s condition is hardly burdensome, and it is necessary.  All we have to do is go.

## Reflections:  
We get asked a lot, “Are you ready to go?”  We may not be ready in that circumstance; our makeup is not done, the kids are not dressed, our presentation is not ready; we are not ready to go.  All that is needed to be ready to go and follow Christ is a decision on our part.  Are you ready to go?
