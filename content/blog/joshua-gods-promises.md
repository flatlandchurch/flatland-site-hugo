**[Joshua 1:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua1:1-5)**

The book of Joshua opens with God commissioning Joshua as the new leader of the Israelites. This did not happen out of the blue. It began forty years prior when Joshua began serving Moses. Joshua was slowly being trained to be Moses' successor. God had a plan all along. Joshua's job appointment was followed by a promise. (Joshua 1:4)

The promise to Joshua and the Israelites was very specific. Not only did God promise them land, he described the precise territory of the land. God also promised his protection. (Joshua 1:5)

Because Joshua accepted God's plan for him, God kept his promises. He provided
shelter and escape for Joshua's spies through Rahab (Joshua 2). He caused the
flooding Jordan River to dry up so that the Jews could cross and enter the land (Joshua 3). God caused the walls to fall down in the battle of Jericho, and the sun to stand still in the sky for an entire day in the battle of Gibeon, leading to victory for the Israelites in these battles. They captured the land of Canaan, as God promised.

God has had a plan all along. If we follow his plan, he will never leave us nor forsake
us.
>  _"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."_ [Jeremiah 29:11(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah29:11)

**Questions:**
1. What does God have planned for you? Are you following His plan and trusting in
His protection?
2. The miracles in our lives may not be as obvious as the walls of Jericho and the
sun in Gibeon. What miracles has God worked in your life?
