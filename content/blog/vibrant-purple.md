Isn’t it interesting how we always want life to be easy, but we tend to find ourselves in overwhelming circumstances?  At that point, we’re wondering how we got there and more importantly, how do we get out?  How do we escape things that become roadblocks?  While the answer may be simple, the execution is not.  

**Problem: Difficult Circumstances Steal Our Joy**

What is the true definition of joy?  According to Merriam-Webster, joy is the emotion evoked by well-being, success, or good fortune or by the prospect of possessing what one desires.  Is that it?  It seems like that definition from the dictionary is dry and doesn’t invoke much joy.  So then what does the Bible say about joy?

In Philippians, we read about the joy Paul had because the people in Philippi were preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.  The some of the first verses within Philippians 1:3-6 (NLT):

> Every time I think of you, I give thanks to my God. Whenever I pray, I make my requests for all of you with joy, for you have been my partners in spreading the Good News about Christ from the time you first heard it until now. And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.

Paul knew that the people in Philippi were doing as Christ commanded them.  He praises and thanks them for their continued prayer while he was in prison in verses 18 and 19:

> But that doesn’t matter. Whether their motives are false or genuine, the message about Christ is being preached either way, so I rejoice. And I will continue to rejoice. For I know that as you pray for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ helps me, this will lead to my deliverance.

These verses show us how much joy Paul had because he believed that he was in the right place at the right time.  No matter what the circumstance is, God is there.  He’s there when everything is going great, and He’s there whenever we’re at our lowest point.  However, we have to remember that even when God is with us, it’s doesn’t guarantee that we won’t go through rough patches.  The best part is that’s He’s there anyway:

> And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. ~Romans 8:38-39

Joy or lack of joy can make or break our daily lives.  When we have days that aren’t as joyous, it can impact our current season of life.  Going back to Philippians, Paul prays that the people’s love will continue to grow and overflow.  This includes growing through difficult times.  God makes it easier for us because He gives us the discernment we need.  When we mess up, we tend to try and fix the problem rather than admitting what we did.  Think of people who get in trouble with the law.  When they try to fix their mistakes, they make everything worse.  Then you have people that admit the mistake they made.  Most of the time, they will receive a lighter sentence or ticket because they admit what they did.  (P.S., we’re talking about getting a speeding ticket, not committing a serious crime).  It’s essential that we remember in every circumstance, there’s a lesson to be taught.  Andy Stanley provides a great question we can ask ourselves:

> In light of my past experiences, my current circumstances, and my future hopes and dreams, what is the wise thing to do?

Paul even expresses his version in Philippians 1:12-14 :

> And I want you to know, my dear brothers and sisters, that everything that has happened to me here has helped to spread the Good News. For everyone here, including the whole palace guard, knows that I am in chains because of Christ. And because of my imprisonment, most of the believers here have gained confidence and boldly speak God’s message without fear.

When we trust in God, we need to know that he will give us the righteousness we need through every situation.   We need to remember that Jesus gave us access to the Holy Spirit that helps produce fruit (Galatians 5:22-23).  If we focus on Him and the righteousness only He can provide, responding to certain situations can be easier.  Even when we’re wrong, we’ll be able to admit our mistakes and move forward.


We’re sure you’re wondering what this blog post had to do with the color purple and being Vibrant.  It all comes down to this:

> The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard of the governor’s headquarters (called the Praetorium) and called out the entire regiment. They dressed him in a purple robe, and they wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head. Then they saluted him and taunted, “Hail! King of the Jews!” And they struck him on the head with a reed stick, spit on him, and dropped to their knees in mock worship. When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified. ~Mark 15:16-19

In the end, we’re all royalty, and God has many things in store for us.  It’s up to us to determine if we’re ready to embrace what He has in store.  The color purple is very important because it is a royal color.  Jesus was clothed in purple after He was beaten.  They mocked Him, but they didn’t know that He was the real King and that God was with Him even through the worst trial.  At the end of each of the morning services on Sunday, everyone was encouraged to take a purple fabric square.  This small square was meant to be a reminder that we are all clothed in purple and are royal in God’s eyes.  He desires a relationship with us and knows where we need to be.  If you didn’t get a purple square, have no fear.  You can find a purple shirt, tie, shoes, etc.  It’s everywhere if you’re willing to open your eyes and look.
