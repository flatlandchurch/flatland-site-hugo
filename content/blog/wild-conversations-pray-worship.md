[**Acts 16**][1]

It’s in our nature to respond naturally. This may sound ridiculously obvious, but the fact is that if we don’t keep this truth in the forefront of our thinking, we’ll make worldly choices all on our own, without asking God to help us. And believe me, God is right there at our side, ready, willing and able to help us make godly decision.

When reviewing Acts 16, I’m hard pressed to find another single chapter in the Bible which lists more opportunities to solve disruptions with obvious natural responses. Read it for yourself and see how many you can count. In the meantime let me list some:
Beginning in verse 16, the slave owners wanted their slave to remain demon possessed. When their lives were disrupted, they responded. The crowd at the marketplace had their lives disrupted and they responded to that disruption. The city officials had their lives disrupted and they responded. The jailer had his routine disrupted a couple of times and he responded. Even Paul and Silas who were doing the will of God had their lives disrupted and they responded.

Paul and Silas, in prison for doing good, chose to respond unnaturally; they praised and worshipped God. When the earthquake came and their chains fell away from them and the prison doors flung wide open, they didn’t rush out, they responded unnaturally. When the only witness to their potential escape wanted to kill himself, they responded unnaturally. When the city officials gave them permission to leave the jail in peace, they responded unnaturally.

Because of their unnatural responses the demon possessed girl was no longer a slave to the demon, nor her masters. Because of their unnatural responses, the city officials realized their mistake in arresting innocent men who were just doing the will of God. Because of their unnatural responses, the jailer not only lived, but he and his entire household received salvation in Jesus Christ.

How many times is your life disrupted by someone and the first thing that comes to mind is that you just want to end the disruption with a natural response? Do you issue a harsh word? Are you short with them? Do you avoid eye contact? Well, God wants us to respond differently. God wants us to respond supernaturally. And the only way we can do what God wants is if we think to praise and worship Him in all circumstances, trusting that He has us in that disrupted situation to accomplish His work of salvation.

> _Even at that hour of the night, the jailer cared for them and washed their wounds. Then he and everyone in his household were immediately baptized. He brought them into his house and set a meal before them, and he and his entire household rejoiced because they all believed in God._ Acts 16:33-34 NLT
