My feet hurt. There are days when walking is so unbearable that I just want to give up ever standing much less walking. The medication I take for it helps most of the time but there are other times sleep is fleeting as my feet are screaming, especially if I forget to take my medication. I have been hounded by this neuropathy for many years. But the hounding is nothing like the hounding of the Enemy who wants me to give up on God. Bah humbug to the Enemy.

The Enemy wants to make our spiritual feet hurt so much that we give up in our walk with Christ. He wants to see us slowly drift away from God and His presence. He wants us to forget our spiritual medication; prayer, reading the Bible, fasting, and the other spiritual disciplines. 

But we need to hear the [lesson of the persistent widow][1]. God is there for us. He will answer our prayers and quickly. We need to be persistent and not give up. We need to constantly strive to move to the center of His love. We need faith in Him and not give up. He is coming soon!

> _Lord, how many are my foes!  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; How many rise up against me!  
> Many are saying of me,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; “God will not deliver him.”  
> But you, Lord, are a shield around me,  
> my glory, the One who lifts my head high.  
> I call out to the Lord,  
> and he answers me from his holy mountain._ -[Psalms‬ ‭3:1-4‬ ‭NIV][2]‬‬
