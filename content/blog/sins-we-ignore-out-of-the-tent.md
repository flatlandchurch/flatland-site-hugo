[‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭3:10-17][1]‬‬‬

Nothing like having the first major point the pastor says in his sermon “Anyone who wants to be godly will be persecuted.” Of course he was just [quoting Paul][2]. But most of us don't willingly get out of our Christian comfort zone. We fear failure and persecution. Yet that is God’s call on our lives. To not live that call is to ignore God.

[We can't hide in a tent hoping a bear won't find us][3]. Hiding in a tent does only one thing, keep us from seeing the wondrous things God does. Oh yeah, and we will never see the bear until it rips through that flimsy tent, surprise! God has so much more for us, [as Jesus said][8], "open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest."

Regarding the call, Paul says [“as we have opportunity....”][4] It helps and challenges at the same time to know this. We are _not_ called to go out, seek, and kick the hornets nest. _We are not seeking out persecution._ We are called to keep our eyes open for those times when we can [**“do good”**][5] and [speak the Good News][6] that we may bring others to Christ and build up fellow Christians. At times people will be receptive and other times we will be rejected. Our call is to use the opportunity, maybe face persecution, but in all things let God work.

> _“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.”_ -‭‭[Galatians‬ ‭6:9-10][7]‬ ‭
