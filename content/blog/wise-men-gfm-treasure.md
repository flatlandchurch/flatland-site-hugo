[**Matthew 2:10-11**][1]

Wise men bow down and worship Jesus and give Him gifts that they treasure. Think of it. These guys aren’t idiots, they’re highly educated people bowing down in worship of Jesus. How wise could we possibly claim to be if we didn’t view ourselves as unworthy to approach Jesus in any other way, fully aware of His greatness, in contrast to our inferiority.

Noteworthy, is the fact that they display honor to their King, by presenting Him gifts that they treasure dearly.  These are the finest gifts of the highest value to them, not some tchotchke they picked up at a thrift store along the way. Once again, they set the bar for the rest of us.

How much do you treasure the privilege being able to come before your King, at any hour of the day, and finding him pleased to see you while offering you His full attention? How much do you treasure the gifts that He gives you, holding absolutely nothing back from you, to the extent of His life? Wise men, coming to Jesus’ house, bring the very best from their treasure when they come.

How much do you treasure what you give to Jesus?

> _“Cursed is the cheat who promises to give a fine ram from his flock but then sacrifices a defective one to the Lord. For I am a great king,” says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, “and my name is feared (respected) among the nations!”_  Malachi 1:14 New Living Translation
