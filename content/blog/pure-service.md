[**1 Corinthians 7:7-40**][week6]

> _Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you were working for the Lord and not for people. For Christ is the real Master you serve._ -[Colossians 3:23-24][col3]

We are called to serve the church in order to bring glory to God and advance the gospel of Jesus. To do this, our hearts must be in that service.  We all have spiritual gifts bestowed upon us, and we each have a passion. Passion is what drives us to do our best, it can influence others, it makes serving less of a duty or obligation.  Serving with passion and utilizing the gifts that God has given us assures that our hearts are in that service. 

Not everyone has a passion for working with children.  As much as we need people in children’s ministry, anyone without this passion who steps up to the call for volunteers out of a sense of duty would not be serving the Lord.  God is not calling us to “suck it up” and serve. He calls us to ignite the passion within and use it to serve willingly and joyfully.  The same person who does not have a heart for children’s ministry may have a passion for music, for creating, for greeting...the church has a place for each of us, where we can serve him with our whole heart. 

What is God calling you to do? What is the burden you feel in your heart? Where is God leading you to focus your efforts?
