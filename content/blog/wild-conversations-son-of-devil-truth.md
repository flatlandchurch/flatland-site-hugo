[**Acts 13:4-12**][acts13]

We feel paralyzed when people oppose our belief in Jesus. Ironically, the people that attack us for believing in Jesus often proclaim we need to live our own truth. They want us to believe anything as long as it doesn’t conflict with something they believe. As such, we often don’t know what to do when people stand against the Gospel, especially when they attack us personally for believing it.

The problem today, truth has become something nebulous. Truth is no longer an absolute, it has become whatever _I_ want it to be. But God says that definition is complete hogwash. Truth is absolute in Him. Jesus declared himself to be the truth ([John 14:6][jhn146]). He said that we have to worship God in truth ([John 4:21ff][jhn421]). How? Jesus prayed for his disciples and us that God would sanctify (make them holy) by God’s truth ([John 17:17][jhn1717]). The truth, Jesus Christ, is that which makes us holy and able to stand before the Lord God Almighty [without fear][heb10]. God’s truth transforms us to live in His truth by the Holy Spirit.

Since we can enter into the presence of God confidently ([Hebrews 10:19][heb10]), how much more can we stand confidently before those who would deny Christ, attack our beliefs, and persecute us. When equipped with the Truth by the Holy Spirit, we can proclaim the [true Light of the World][jhn1] without being paralyzed for God’s truth is greater than their “truth.”

> _Lead me by your truth and teach me,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are the God who saves me.    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long I put my hope in you._ -Psalm 25:5
