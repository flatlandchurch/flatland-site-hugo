#### [John 18:36-38][1]

“Truth is relative” is a statement that self-implodes, or destroys itself. By definition, it means: “Truth can differ according to individual viewpoints”. Simply using the statement’s own definition, we know that as long as people in the world have different viewpoints, the statement itself can never be proven to be true (let that sink in). Trying a murder case, for example, would always conclude with a hung jury as long as the opinions of the prosecution and the defense differ. There would literally be no need for jails and prisons if truth was actually relative.

In this ever-changing world where opinions are expressed as fact and right and wrong are as fleeting as current trends, we need to know if there’s any genuine truth that passes the tests of time and trends. This is where the phrase “God only knows” is as relevant today as it was when mankind was first created. God is perfect. And, by definition, nothing perfect can change because if it did it would become less perfect or more perfect (let that sink in). The main problem with man-made things is that they are temporary. People standing on man-made wisdom are standing on shifting ground. But when we stand on the truth of God, we’re standing on solid ground. [God is perfect and His perfect truth always has and always will be in solid perfect condition throughout time and eternity.][2]

If you know nothing of the Bible other than the fact that your perfect Creator loves you and wants to be with you forever (again, let that sink in), you have a solid basic understanding of the Bible. With that as a foundation, we can now continue to build on our understanding of [all that He’s passed down to us through His Word/Scriptures.][4] God’s Word is the solid foundation upon which we can confidently build our lives because it withstands the constant barrage of opinion and viewpoint throughout every generation. We first need know, and then to internalize – or let the Truth of God “sink in” – in order for it to transform us from people struggling with the stress of constantly changing with every trend into stable people enjoying [the peace of God which transcends all worldly (man-made) thinking.][3]

### Reflections
- How important is to you personally to know your life isn’t built on shifting ground?
- What response, if any, do you give someone who says “Truth is relative” or “There is no absolute truth”? Do you ask, for example, if that statement is absolutely true?
- Since the truth reveals lies, how can you better internalize peace-giving truth in increasing measure and discard stressful lies for what they are?
