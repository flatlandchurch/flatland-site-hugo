[Colossians 1:15-2:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians1:15-2:3)

[Col. 1:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians1:13-14) spoke of God the Father bringing us into the kingdom of his Son. This week's passage begins with consideration of the awesome realities about that Son.

* List and consider all of the aspects of Jesus.
  1. What feelings do these verses create in you?
  2. What response do these realities call for?

Col 1:2 called the letter's recipients "holy people" or "saints." Col 1:4-5 speaks of their faith. This week, Col 1:21 indicates that they used to be separated from God, enemies of God. But now God has brought them together with God, through the death of the Son, which is how it became possible for them to be forgiven, complete, and holy.

* How does Col 1:23 indicate they can keep or retain their status as saints?

We were called out of darkness into the light of Christ. We have been made new, without blemish or accusation through the saving work Jesus did on the cross. Instead of being enemies of God we are now His children.

* How should we respond to God's great love and sacrifice?
