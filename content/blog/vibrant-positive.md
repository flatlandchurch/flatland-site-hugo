### [Philippians 2:12-30][1]

We all have that friend, the one who is always complaining, negativity constantly spewing from his mouth, nothing positive to say about anything.

If weâ€™re not careful, we may buy into his constant grumblings and become negative ourselves.  Or, we try to reassure this friend, hoping to turn his attitude around.  Some of us may end up distancing ourselves from him, in the interest of our own well-being.

Paul was the perfect example of positivity.  Instead of complaining about his imprisonment, he wrote letters to his friends in Philippi, sending them positive thoughts, continuing to minister to them from his cell, where he could have drowned himself in sorrow and self-pity.  Paul continued his friendship with Timothy, his mentee, companion, partner, and sent Timothy to Philippi to check on the well-being of his friends there.  Paul set an example for his friends, an example of being Christ-like.  He did what Jesus would have done.

> _But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.  So you too should be glad and rejoice with me._ Philippians 2:17-18

### Tasks:
1. Pray for your friends who are negative.
2. Pray that their negativity will not affect your relationship with Christ.
3. Be an example of light in the face of sorrow.
