This week we have been studying the hot topic of climate change from a biblical perspective.  We are to be good stewards of the earth, while keeping from panic in the matter of global warming with the knowledge that God is in control.  We also have a stewardship role in caring for the unsaved souls of our fellow humans.

Yes, the day will come when this planet we’re visiting is no more.  That can be a scary thought, or it can be a hopeful thought.  It’s scary to think of losing the only home we’ve ever known.  But “all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children really are” ([Romans 8:19][rom89]).  As much as we love this home, all of creation will continue to suffer in frustration under the curses of God in response to sin.

God didn't subject creation to decay, to frustration, out of pettiness or revenge. Instead, He acted in hope of the day when He will reveal His children in the glory He has for us, and then creation is free from its bondage.  If we endure that suffering while caring for this home and its creatures, we can live in anticipation of the day of glory.

> _He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away._  ~[Revelation 21:1-4][rev21]
