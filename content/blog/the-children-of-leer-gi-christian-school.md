Many of the children who attend this school are being raised in devastating poverty. Most of them come from homes that do not have electricity and only a few of them have running water. In fact, almost three-quarters of these children exhibit some form of malnutrition. Other children face different kinds of obstacles to receive an education. For in- stance, one boy came late to class and apologized to his teacher, ex- plaining that his mother had died in the night. 
This school offers children like this boy a new destiny for this life and the one to come. Leer Gi school is a powerful ministry because it puts children from Muslim homes in class with teachers who are converted Muslims. The school is permitted by Senegalese law to give one hour of religious instruction per week, the only stipulation being that the religious text used is “old and authoritative.” This loophole allows us to use the Bible, rather than the Koran, for instruction of all of our students. 
The students often ask teachers for prayer in the name of Jesus for all kinds of needs. Once a father stormed into the school office, outraged that he had found his daughter at home praying in the name of Jesus! 
Another boy, after receiving three years of weekly Bible lessons, asked his teacher to lead him in a prayer to have The Lord in his heart. As the years go by, testimonies like these will continue to snowball! This is how the spiritual stronghold of northern Senegal will be torn down. More children in northern Senegal need your help to expand this ministry by opening a second school.
