[**1 Corinthians 7:7-40**][week6]

It is interesting how our views regarding the apostle Paul colors the way we interpret what he writes. We often view everything he says as absolute. But verse 26 is pretty clear, Paul often writes his own opinions, well informed, but still opinions that are colored by his own training and societal upbringing. He is biased towards being single because there can be less distractions from serving the Lord. He imagines being constantly distracted by a wife and her needs so is content being single.

Paul’s opinion in verse 26 is that in light of the soon coming of Christ (see verse 29) marriage is a distraction. But he also acknowledges that it isn’t always easy to be single and that marriage is often the only answer to the couple who are not [“acting honorably”][honorably]. It is a distraction that he doesn’t have but is a problem for many.

Paul wants us to be free from distractions so we might serve God with everything we have. [Jesus is coming soon][soon] and we don’t have a lot of time to proclaim the Gospel. As such, if you can be single without distractions, be single. If you can be married without distractions, be married. Just do everything honorably and for the Lord.
