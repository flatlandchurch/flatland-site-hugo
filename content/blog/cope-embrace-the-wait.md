We often fear the unknown.  When the unknown becomes experience, we are less afraid.  A child is afraid of falling off his bike, until he gains experience in riding.  We may be afraid of flying, of thunderstorms, of medical injections...but the more experience we gain, the less afraid we are.  Knowing what is happening and what will happen next brings peace.

The disciples must have been terrified of what would happen next.  Their Lord was leaving them, and they would be persecuted for their faith.  But Jesus knew exactly what would happen next; He promised the gift of the Advocate who would continue his work in them [(John 14:26)][1].

“Do not let your hearts be troubled.” [(John 14:1)][2].  Though trials and suffering would come their way, the disciples needed not fear. Their Lord was leaving them with a peace unlike any that is gained through earthly experience, a peace that only comes with a trust in God’s promise.

We need not fear the unknown, because He knows.  And He has us covered.

> _I am leaving you with a gift—peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don’t be troubled or afraid._ [(John 14: 27)][3]
