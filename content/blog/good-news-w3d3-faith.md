#### [John 1:12][j1]
The difference between the words faith and believe in Greek is as simple as noun and verb; the noun is pistis, the verb pisteuo both from the same root word, for example, [Romans 3:22][1] has both. There is a subtle difference in the Bible between the two. ‘Faith’ almost always has as its source God (see [Ephesians 2:8][2]). ‘Believe’ many of the times can be translated “to have faith”; i.e., to have a God-given faith in God. However believe can also be a head knowledge. [For example][3], "Even demons believe and shudder.” They believe the facts, but have no actual faith in Jesus.

[James][4] shows us the difference. Faith is more than a head knowledge. Faith, when we believe in the name, changes us so that we honor the name in our actions. Faith bears fruit. True belief doesn't just sit on a log and say, "I believe." True “I believe" results in chopping that log up, throwing it in the smoker, and cooking up a delicious meal, both for the spiritually hungry and for those in need of physical help. 

[An early event in the Church[a3] shows us how faith isn’t just a head thing. Peter and John see a man lame from birth begging at a gate of the temple. They look at him and say “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” In their explanation of what happened they say, “By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him.” Faith in the name of Jesus results in the miraculous. Ready to believe, to have faith? Lets Move!

### Challenge
