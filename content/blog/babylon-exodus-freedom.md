[**Exodus 12-15, 20**][1]

Egypt had become a type of Babylon. Their hearts became hard against God and they wanted to make a name for themselves. They made their own “Egyptian gods” and worshiped them instead. Yet, a single remnant of Israel, Joseph, lived in Egypt and continued to worship the one true God. God used the faithfulness of this one man to rescue all of Israel from seven years of famine. Not just rescue, but put them in the land of Goshen, a prime piece of real estate for raising flocks and herds.

At this point in history, we have no indication that Pharoah would have denied Joseph any request. Going way out on a limb here, I can’t help but wonder why Israel didn’t go back home immediately after the famine. My mind wonders if this oasis of comfort and plenty made it too easy for the Israelites to stay in Babylon. It’s easy for us, in hindsight, to see how effortlessly Babylon takes the comfortable captive. But, is it easy to recognize this as it happens to us today?

In our reading today, we see how God rescued His faithful and, in the same moment, decimated Babylon. This wasn’t an easy or overnight occurrence by any stretch. But to the patient, God always comes through, blessing the faithful and judging the wicked.

Out of what Babylon is God calling you? How comfortable have you become in your ways of pursuing your own happiness? How’s that working out for you? When seeking fulfillment, Babylon will always tease us with the claim that the next “thing” will fulfill us. Babylon tells us that **_then_** we can have peace, **_then_** we can finally rest in our fulfillment. That lie never changes; Babylon is not creative. The truth is that finding our fulfillment in the One who never misleads us is finding true fulfillment. Getting our peace from the Prince of Peace is the only peace that will begin now and last for eternity. Jesus is leading the way out of a temporary defective man-made comfort zone into His eternal perfect rest and comfort. How are you responding to Him?

> _Come to Me, all of you who work and have heavy loads. I will give you rest._ Matthew 11:28 NLV
