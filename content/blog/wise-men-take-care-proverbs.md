Proverbs has a lot to say about money, contrasting the wise and the foolish. Money it seems is not so much the problem as our use and abuse of it. We need money to live but when we are foolish in our use of money, that is when the problems start. Wise use of money involves [hard work][p1211], [saving][p2120], [providing for those in need][p1917] and a [godly lifestyle][p2121]. Foolish use of money involves [laziness][p2125], [greed][p2825], [dishonesty][p2010] and a lot of [spending on luxury][p2117].

A wise person seeks after God first and foremost, living simply and honestly. [God will provide][mat633] for a righteous person so that they have what they need and a little more so that they may also provide for those who are in need. Those who foolishly chase after money and spend it on pleasure will end up impoverished. Even the really rich [will end up poor in the end][jam51] but those who seek God first will have riches for eternity.

> _The one whose walk is blameless is kept safe,_
> _but the one whose ways are perverse will fall into the pit._

> _Those who work their land will have abundant food,_
> _but those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty._

> _A faithful person will be richly blessed,_
> _but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished._

> _The stingy are eager to get rich_
> _and are unaware that poverty awaits them._ -Proverbs 28:18-22
