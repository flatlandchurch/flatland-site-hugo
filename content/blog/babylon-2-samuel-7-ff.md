**[2 Samuel 7][1], [1 Kings 3-5][2]**

David one day got to looking around his house. It was a pretty magnificent mansion. He may have then looked over the hills towards the old tabernacle and saw a run down, ancient tent—it _was_ a couple hundred years old and made from animal skins—bet it had a funky smell. David realized that was just wrong. God’s place among His people should be magnificent. David set out to do just that but God had a different plan, David’s son would be the one to build the temple. David was a man of war [and not acceptable][3] to be the one to build.

Now David could have said, “Hey, **_I_** AM KING, **_I_** will build the temple.” But he listened to what God said to him and humbled himself. He responded with “Who am I?” and “You YHWH are great, you have spoken, I believe, I will obey.” Rebellion was a great potential, being king has a tendency to cause that, and David was a mighty king. But being no ordinary king, he trusted God’s Word, bowing to the sovereignty of the Lord.

That isn’t to say David was lax. He helped his son build the temple by establishing the location of the temple and started gathering needed materials for it (see [1 Chronicles 22][4]). But he didn’t rebel, he obeyed.

There are times in our lives when we get a vision of doing something, it could be something great for God **_but_** He can step in and direct us onto a different path. The vision itself isn't bad. It may very well be a good thing. But we are presented with the choice, rebel and follow our own vision or listen and obey the will of God.

> _Trust in the Lord with all your heart_   
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lean not on your own understanding;_   
> _in all your ways submit to him,_ 
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will make your paths straight._  
> _Do not be wise in your own eyes;_   
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear the Lord and shun evil._   
> _This will bring health to your body_   
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nourishment to your bones._   
> _Honour the Lord with your wealth,_   
> ￼_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the firstfruits of all your crops;_   
> _then your barns will be filled to overflowing,_   
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your vats will brim over with new wine._ -[Proverbs 3:5-10][5] NIV
