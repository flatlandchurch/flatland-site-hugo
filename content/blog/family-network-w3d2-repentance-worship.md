#### [Revelation 19:9-10][1]

The word "worship" is from Old English "worth-ship" – the ascribing of highest worth. Whatever you value or love the most – whatever is your greatest source of significance and security – you are worshipping in your heart. We find ourselves “worth-shipping” a variety of things. Going shopping for the latest fashion or make up ascribes worth to our image and likeness. Chasing a promotion ascribes worth to money. And so on. As Satan was up to his same old trick, trying to garner worship for himself, Jesus ultimately puts an end to the matter by reminding Satan that [only God is worthy of worship.][2] And with that declaration, even Satan submits.

Sinning against another ascribes higher value to ourselves than to them; robbing them of something to pay homage to ourselves. When we do, we must come to terms with the need to repent. We must restore that which was damaged at whatever the cost – whether it be our money, our pride, our image, our comfort, our freedom or a combination of all of these. And we must make a deliberate change in our lives to prevent the possibility of repeating the offense.

Restitution is not optional. In fact, Jesus said we shouldn’t bother trying to worship Him with any sense of authentic reverence, if we haven’t [first restored any damage we’ve caused to our family network.][3] Divisiveness and placing worth on anything above the Lord delights the heart of the enemy. We’re tempted away from diligently working out our problems and making amends. Restitution always involves sacrificing ourselves. The good news is that [it’s this very type of sacrifice that pleases our God and ascribes worth to Him.][4]

### Challenges
- What “worth” do you place on yourself?
- Could placing worth only on God transfrom your life?
- Does the thought of having your entire life transformed frighten or excite you?
