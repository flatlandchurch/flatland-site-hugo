#### [John 1:4][1]
 
Life is a gift, something we didn’t earn or even ask for. As human beings, every one of us seeks to know the answer to the ultimate question: “What am I supposed to do with this gift?” Some variants include “What is the purpose/meaning of life?” And/or “How am I supposed to live this life out?” Regardless of how we phrase the question, we have a deep longing within us that no other creature has.

If we were merely animals, we would simply be concerned with seeking and gathering our daily food, and accessing shelter from elements and predators. We would be free from stress over the affairs of tomorrow and be living only for the moment. In this case, we would be as care free as a bird. But we do care. And this makes it obvious to us that life for humans is more than merely existing. More than just seeking and gathering things, which may bring us temporary happiness, but a feeling which lasts no longer than the time it takes for us to want the next thing.

[God, our Creator, made mankind through a process that was completely different from all other creation][2] for several reasons. Note, for example, that we’re the only creation invited into fellowship and conversation with God – we’re the only creation invited into prayer. [It should be obvious by studying creation][3] that taking advantage of the enormously generous invitation to speak with our Creator is both a privilege and the pathway God has put in place to get the answers to how to live human life out to the fullest. After all, the one who dies with the most toys is dead. Seeking first to know the one we’re talking with, and then living life out in daily communion with God who is, by far, greater than all things combined, is the only way to life in eternal satisfaction.

### Challenges
- If you’re breathing, God has successfully provided everything you need thus far. Is there any reason to believe God is going to start failing now?
- Does having your needs met by God satisfy you or are you in pursuit of more than you need?
- How important is it to you to seek to know God and then ask Him to reveal the “secret” to living a satisfying life?
