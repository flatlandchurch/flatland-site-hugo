[**Today’s reading: John 9 – Blindness**][jhn9]

In our continuing study of John’s Gospel today, we see Jesus heal a blind man.  While such a miracle is amazing, it seems common to our Lord.  All four Gospels record blind people being healed by Jesus, this time, on the Sabbath.  As with other miraculous works performed by Jesus on the Sabbath, many of the hypocritically-legalistic Pharisees think they have found fault in Jesus.

Calling the man and his parents to testify, the Pharisees investigate.  The parents of this man are in bit of a tight spot here and, in a sense, throw their son under the bus when asked if they can corroborate his story.  After all, if they confirm their son had an encounter with the Christ, they could lose their spot in the synagogue.  Subsequent to the investigation, the parties seem to go their separate ways and soon the man finds himself standing before Jesus.  But, having never seen Him, doesn’t know who he’s talking to.

“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”, Jesus asks.  In response, note that all this man needs in order to believe is to have the Son of Man identified.  The Pharisees, on the other hand, have had the ability to see their whole lives and study the Word of the Lord.  What’s more, they now see the Word – living and working right before them.  Because of this man’s “blind” faith he now sees, physically and spiritually, with crystal clarity.  But, because of the Pharisees unimpeded ability to see physically, they shamefully display their spiritual blindness.

Are you stumbling due to any blindness?  Could you use more light in your life?

> _While I am in the world, I am the light of the world._ -[John 9:5][jhn95]
