#### [John 1:12-13][1]
[Sunday sermon][2] presented the Faith Grid showing the balance between believing and obeying. There are four quadrants in which we can find ourselves; rejecting faith, idolatrous faith, hypocritical faith, and saving faith. What struck me, 50% of the grid consists of people that believe they are Christians but are in danger of missing out. Both idolatrous faith and hypocritical faith can blind a person from truthfully following Jesus; they follow something other than the Good Shepherds voice. 

I find the [story of the people][3] who believed but didn’t openly acknowledge their faith sad. They were locked by their fear of rejection and the loss of status. They were stuck in the hypocritical faith quadrant of the grid. There are so many people who say “I believe” but do not by their actions show they believe. [Jesus said][4] “If you love me, keep my commands.” I can almost see people pulling out their quill pens and parchment to write down the list of do’s and don’ts. What did Jesus command? “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.” ([John 15:12]()[jn15]()) Obedience isn’t a matter of a list of rules--that drops you into the idolatrous faith quadrant. Obedience is a matter of following Jesus’ example--doing God’s will (loving Him), putting others first, loving them to the point of laying his life down that we might live.

We all probably find ourselves wandering to one side or the other of that grid at times; a head belief without obedience or a faith based on good works. Invariably the cause is not fellowshipping with other believers who are solidly in the saving faith area of the grid. We need to actively involve ourselves in [life groups][7] to help keep balanced between head knowledge and obedience. There are times when we may find we need [mentoring][8] or [coaching][9] to help us move in the right direction. Let’s take the steps to balance our Christian belief with Christian obedience. Let’s get together. Let’s move.

### Challenge
Where do you find yourself landing on the grid? Do you find yourself lacking obedience or are you such a stickler for obedience that love for others gets left behind?
