### Good Friday

On the day we now refer to as Good Friday, Jesus hung on a cross for six hours.  During the first three hours, sin ran rampant around the cross.  Soldiers cast lots for his clothing.  The crowd, including chief priests and teachers of religious law, mocked him.  The chief priest criticized Pilate’s inscription on the cross, “King of the Jews”.  One of the thieves who was being crucified beside him scoffed him for being unable to save himself.  

In the midst of this sin, while Jesus hung on the cross in excruciating pain, struggling just to breathe, he answered the cry for mercy from the other dying thief, promising him eternal life.  He interceded for those who crucified and mocked him, asking his Father to forgive them.  He selflessly entrusted his mother’s well-being to his friend John.    

In the final three hours, darkness fell over the land. It was the day of preparation for Passover, which always occurred during a full moon.  It was noon, and the sun had been shining all morning.  Yet God the Father drew a thick veil of darkness over the horrific scene, silencing those incapable of understanding this most profound truth of the Holy of Holies. 

In the sixth hour, Jesus broke the silence with a cry out to his Father, quoting scripture:

> _My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?_  [Psalm 22:1][1]

And the veil was torn in two, from top to bottom. 

> _Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water._  [Hebrews 10:19-22][2]

### Reflections:

For those who are unsaved, a thick veil still exists.  Claiming Jesus as our Lord and savior is the only way to tear it down.  A darkness may preside over our lives, drawn by the enemy, silencing us from understanding the most profound truth of the Holy of Holies.  Today is the day to tear the veil in two, from top to bottom, light up the darkness, silence the enemy.  Today is Good Friday. 

> _This is the day the LORD has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it._  [Psalm 118:24][3]
