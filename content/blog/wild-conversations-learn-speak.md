[**Acts 14:8-20**][acts14]

A man of Lystra sitting (of course he was, he couldn't walk since birth) listening to Paul had faith. That faith saved the man spiritually. But Paul took it one step further. Seeing the man's faith, told him to stand up. The man didn't just stand tentatively, in faith he jumped up and began walking. I imagine that unlike a small child who stumbles and falls as it learns to walk, this man just became a champion walker. Amazing thing faith.

But the man's faith didn't just pop out of nowhere. It came from sitting at the feet of Paul and listening to the Gospel. Paul was a well educated man, having been taught at the feet of Gamaliel, one of the leading religious leaders in Jerusalem and in all of Judaism. Paul learned all about God from Gamaliel. That wasn't lost. Paul's knowledge of Scripture fed into his faith in Jesus Christ. He then passed that knowledge and faith to others as he spoke. And a lame man began to walk.

We are called to sit and listen to God's Word, allow it to build up our faith. We are also called to then speak that message of Good News of Jesus Christ. We are to spread our faith to others. We don't have to be awesome speakers like Paul. We don't have to go to the best theological school in the land like Paul. We can be like the lame man who simply listened to the message and filled with faith began to walk. We can learn by reading and studying the Bible, by attending Life Groups, by attending core classes, the NextStep class, by getting a mentor and of course by sitting at the feet of our great pastors preaching the Word every Sunday. We have great opportunities to learn and every day we have the opportunity to spread the Gospel to those around us. And lame people will begin to walk.

> _But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, “How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!”_ -Romans 10:14-15 (NLT)
