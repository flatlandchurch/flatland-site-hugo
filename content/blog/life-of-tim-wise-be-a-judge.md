[**2 Timothy 3**][2tim3]

The term “judgement” tends to carry with it negative connotations.  _Do not judge, or you too will be judged_ [(Matthew 7:1)][1].  But to judge simply means to form an opinion or conclusion about. We judge, or should judge on a daily basis.  Lest we not judge, we may fall astray with the wrong company.

Jesus said, _“Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.”_ [(John 7:24)][2].  The new girl in your life group with purple hair exudes genuine love of others, while the co-worker you have lunch with everyday dresses in designer clothes and spends the lunch hour poking fun at how others in the restaurant are dressed.  Judge accordingly, for _their love for others will prove to the world that they are his disciples.”_ [(John 13:35)][3].

Judge for the right reasons.  Are you judging someone because they wronged you, and are you wishing damnation upon them?  Or are you judging them for their explicit sinful behavior, and praying for their redemption?  Either way you have the choice to keep them in your life or not.  Judge prayerfully, for _the person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things._ [(1 Corinthians 2:15)][4].

Paul warned Timothy to _have nothing to do with people having a form of godliness but denying its power._ [(2 Timothy 3:5)][5].  Judge wisely.

>_A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them._ [(Matthew 7:18-20)][6]
