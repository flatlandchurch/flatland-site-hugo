[**Acts 26**][acts26]

Before King Agrippa Paul asks a question that is central to our faith, “Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?” The resurrection of Christ is the pivot point of our beliefs. [Paul says][1co1512] that without the resurrection Christianity is a waste of time. As such, we have to examine ourselves. Do we truly believe Jesus was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and will return soon? Do we believe we too will be resurrected?

We need to serously consider, is God able to raise the dead? Is it incredulous that God has that power? Did God leave Jesus in the grave or did He actually raise Jesus from the dead? Our faith is in the sacrifice that Jesus did for us on the cross but our faith doesn’t stop at the grave, it includes the resurrection of Jesus, and in our own resurrection. Our faith is in the power of God.

Paul says, “What I am saying is true and reasonable.” He had the entire Scripture to back him up as well as the eye witnesses to the resurrection. We can reject the resurrection but in doing so we reject that which is true and reasonable. Yes, it is impossible for us to prove it now... well, except for how God has changed us--the proof is in our lives. When we allow Christ’s life glow in our lives, people will see the truth. When we proclaim that truth they will have no choice but to to decide, will they be true and reasonable?

> _The heavens praise your wonders, Lord,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.  
> For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord?   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?   
> In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared;   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is more awesome than all who surround him.   
> Who is like you, Lord God Almighty?   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Lord, are mighty, and your faithfulness surrounds you._ -[Psalm 89:5-8][ps89]
