[**Acts 1:4-5**][1]

Jesus said that if we have faith in Him and no doubt whatsoever, we could [command mountains to be cast into the sea][2]. Some may take this as hyperbole, and to be honest, I doubt that Jesus would actually want us to toss all the mountains into the sea. But the point I think we can all agree on here is that we’re not being empowered like we could. Of course, we have faith, but if we’re completely honest, we can admit that we also have our doubts.

Doubts in the Holy Spirit baptism can be the biggest reason we don’t receive the gift. Some may doubt that the gift is for believers today. Some may doubt themselves, thinking they don’t know how to speak in tongues “correctly”. Some may even think that if they could speak in tongues, those around them would judge them. Whatever the doubt is in our life, it’s based on fear. The good news is that the [Holy Spirit doesn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love and the ability to think clearly.][3]

If you’ve been baptized in the Holy Spirit and have received the gift of tongues, you know how empowering it is. If you haven’t, perhaps you’ve been trying too hard. Of course, you should be praying and fasting. Of course, you should keep asking, keep seeking, and keep knocking. Of course, you should be witnessing to non-believers about the free gift of Salvation in Jesus. This is all perfectly normal daily life for committed Christians. But as we live out our faith, we also have to wait on the Holy Spirit to deliver the gift when we’re ready. After all, it’s His work, not ours. Faith that the Holy Spirit will baptize you when you’re ready will calm any fears, impatience or misconceptions you may have about His empowering gift.

So, live out your faith like you trust God. When you do that, you can honestly relax, or rest, in that faith. God loves showing up when we believe He will do what He says He will do. And, in the meantime don’t forget that He has placed believers all around you to support you and encourage you as you wait on Him.
