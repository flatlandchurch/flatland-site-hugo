[**Psalm 79**][psa79]

“Hypocrite!” It stings when that accusation is thrown at us. In part it stings because no matter how good we are, we are never perfect. The world watches us very close to catch us when we slip. Yet our goal as Christians is to present ourselves before the world in such a way, “they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us” despite the fact they may throw that accusation of hypocrisy ([1 Peter 2:12][1pe212]).

It isn’t easy. Paul expresses this struggle in Roman 7. We are new creations in Christ but we are still human, we still struggle with sin. But Paul continues, we read in the next chapter, that our faith in Christ results in no condemnation from God, the only one who counts. We read that Jesus conquered sin so that the Spirit frees us. When we allow the Spirit to live in us we are “more than conquerors through Him who loved us.”

We may sometimes feel like singing with the psalmist

> _We are objects of contempt to our neighbors,_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp_;of scorn and derision to those around us._ -Psalm 79:4

But we need to stand on the promise that we are more than conquerors and sing

> _I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart;_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I will tell of all your wonderful deeds._
> _I will be glad and rejoice in you;_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High._ -[Psalm 9:1-2][psa9]
