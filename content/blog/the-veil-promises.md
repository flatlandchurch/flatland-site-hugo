People make promises all the time.  Whether a small or big promise, an oath or pledge.  I promise I’ll wash the dishes after dinner; I promise I’ll marry you; I pledge allegiance to the flag; On my honor, I will do my best….

A promise is of no more value than is the ability and willingness of the one who makes it to carry through. People break promises.  They forget, they are negligent, they change their mind, they never meant to do it in the first place; sometimes there are circumstances beyond their control.  

God, however, is steadfast in his promises.  He means it, he won’t forget, neglect, nor change his mind, and nothing is beyond his control.    Abraham trusted God enough to obey and sacrifice his son.  God rewarded him with a substitute sacrifice in the form of a ram. 

It was through Christ that God intended to fulfill his promise to Abraham.  Jesus’s life was then shaped by his trust in the power and promises of God.  Jesus trusted God enough to obey and die on the cross.  God rewarded us with eternal life.  

> _Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life._  [John 5:24][1]

### Questions
1. Has someone in your life broken an important promise to you?  Was it because they didn’t mean it, they forgot, they were negligent, they changed their mind, or were there circumstances beyond their control?   Which of these reasons constitutes lying? 
2. Whose promises do you trust more:  those of people, or those of God?
