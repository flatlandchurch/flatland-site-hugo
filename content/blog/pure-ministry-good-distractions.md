[**1 Corinthians 7:7-40**][week6]

Jesus gives us this command: “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.” ([Mark 16:15][mark16]) Each of us who claims to be a disciple of Jesus is called into His ministry.  How effective we are as ministers varies and, to a large part, depends on what distractions we allow into our ministry.  We can do a lot of good things.  In fact, we can fill an entire day doing good things.  **But are we doing the _right_ thing?**

Many and individualized are the blessings we receive as followers of Christ.  By the grace of God, we have much to enjoy on any given day.  The question is: “Am I chasing after the blessings or am I chasing after the One who blesses?  If I’m distracted with good deeds like trying to be the one responsible for pleasing my spouse, raising my children, making money, eating sumptuous food, achieving the next promotion at work or anything else for that matter, I’m dealing with more pride than faith.

“Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well” ([Matthew 6:33][matt6]).  Wow.  Think of it.  Following Jesus requires a lot of faith, doesn’t it?  If I want to be a better husband or wife, parent, employee – or whatever – do I have faith?  Do I trust that God Himself will make me the best I can possibly be simply because I seek Him with laser-focus?  If you’re distracted from focusing on God by doing good deeds, you may not necessarily be living out the commission Jesus gave you.  However, if you’re right with God, He will faithfully open the doors and direct your footsteps to be a wonderful blessing to those He gives you.

> _Trust in the LORD with all your heart_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_and lean not on your own understanding;_
> _in all your ways submit to him,_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_and he will make your paths straight._ -[Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV)][prov3]
