[Mark 6:45-52][1]

In Mark 6 we read about Jesus walking on water.  What Mark leaves out, but Matthew includes in his gospel, is that Peter also walked on water.

> _Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.   But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!"_  [Matthew 14:29][2]

Peter had the faith to step out on the water, but doubt caused him to look away from Christ.  He became distracted by his situation and allowed fear to take over.  Still, when he called out, "Lord, save me!", the hand of grace pulled him to safety.  We must remember to keep our eyes on the Lord, rather than the circumstances that are threatening us.  We can walk through the waves in our lives with confidence that Jesus has control over every situation.

> _Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"._ [Matthew 14:31][2]

**Questions**

1. Doubt isn't the absence of faith; it is a test of faith.  Peter doubted, but then cried out to the Lord in the presence of fear.  Can you keep your eyes on the Lord during your present situation?  In times of doubt, can you call to the Lord in the midst of fear and trust that he has control of the situation?
2. "Walking on water" has become an idiom used to praise someone's perceived perfection, or ability to do the impossible….."She juggles a successful career, marriage, and raising five children; she walks on water".   Yet Peter was human, and he literally walked on water as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus.  Are we, today, able to walk on water, figuratively, with Jesus's help?
