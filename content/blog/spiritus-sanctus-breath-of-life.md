[**Genesis 2:7**][1]

Who is the Holy Spirit? How would you introduce Him? Well, He’s God. Not a separate God but an equal, indivisible member of the [One True God][2]. He is omnipresent, meaning He is everywhere, including with us in the same room. Our life simply could not exist without Him. We’re just lifeless lumps of clay or dust without Him. But, because He is the breath of life, He literally gives breath into our physical lungs and we are transformed from inanimate into the living. And, He is the one [responsible for remaining with us and sustaining us physically,][3] up to our last breath on earth.

But, far more important than sustaining us physically, the Holy Spirit sustains us spiritually. In this role, He makes it so that our eternal life may be spent with God in Heaven vs living out eternity with Satan. Or, as the Bible refers to it, [“the second death”.][4]  This is the natural result of forfeiting or quenching the free gift of Salvation.

It may seem ironic, but although the Holy Spirit is constantly with us physically, sustaining our physical life, if we don’t breathe deeply from Him spiritually, He will [distance Himself from us _spiritually_][5] and we will die. As an illustration, think about holding your breath. If you could hold your breath long enough, you would die physically. In the same way, if you quench the breath of life - if you resist breathing in the Holy Spirit’s breath of eternal spiritual life - you simply can’t live with Him; He will depart, and you will die spiritually. The good news is that [God has lovingly placed the breath of life well within our reach.][6]

I want to strongly encourage you to plan to be with us throughout this entire series. In it, you will come to know the Holy Spirit better, that we actually need Him, and why we need Him.

> _“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what He is saying to the churches. Whoever is victorious will not be harmed by the second death.”_ Revelation 2:11 NLT
