Many people come to church every Sunday, filled with joy which they carry through the week.  They pray with praise and supplications on a daily basis, honor God in their day to day lives, they’re kind to their neighbors and even witness to others.  Yet they aren’t involved in a ministry in their church.  They don’t see a place where their talents would be useful, or they’re content to just soak it all in every Sunday. 

> _“To each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.”_ -[Ephesians 4:7][1].  

Each of us has a unique role to serve in the diverse Body of Christ.  God knows that role; ask him what it is.  If you’re not getting an answer, consider the following: 
* What do you do for a living?  This can help identify what you’re an expert at, and this expertise may be your calling with your church.  But don’t stop there, because your calling isn’t all about what you do for a paycheck.
* What do you do for fun?
* What are you good at?
* What are you passionate about?
* Ask your friends.  They can often identify a strength you didn’t know you had, or hadn’t considered.
* Start by joining a bible study, core class, or a life group.  The deeper you get into God’s word, in the fellowship of other believers, the more you’ll hear from God.  

> Trust in the Lord with all your heart  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lean not on your own understanding;   
> in all your ways submit to him,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will make your paths straight. -[Proverbs 3:5-6][2]
