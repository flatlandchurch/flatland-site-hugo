**[Today’s Reading: John 4:1-42][jhn4] “I AM He”**

The account of the Samaritan woman at the well is recorded in John, chapter 4.  Note in verse 4, we see that it is “necessary” that Jesus pass through Samaria.  In the original text, this word (Greek “dei”) means something that is binding, necessary, proper, inevitable. Jesus, of course, came first to the Jews according to the faithfulness of God’s Word.  But here we notice, perhaps for the first time, that His mission is the salvation of all of us.  His mission statement comes through very clearly in verse 34, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to finish His work.”  [Creation was the beginning work][jhn1].  [Eternal life][jhn316] with God finishes it.

This woman with no name is well known by Jesus and He makes this clear to her by citing some rather intimate facts about her life and current living conditions.  After seeking distraction through a bit of quibble over the “proper” place of worship, the woman comes to the inevitable fact that “Messiah is coming” (v25).  At this Jesus declares in words anyone can understand; “I AM he”.

Jesus must have come to the Samaritans because, as a Jew, they would never have come to Him.  He appears to a woman who gathers water alone in the heat of the day, an obvious testament to her social position as an outcast.  Though she would never have sought Him out, she receives salvation through faith in Him.  Furthermore, beginning in verse 39, we see the people of the town, who would never have sought this woman out for anything good, find salvation through her testimony as they’re inspired to come to Jesus.

How has Jesus appeared to you?  How do others receive salvation by what you say about Jesus, even though they aren’t necessarily “seeking you out”?

> _But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth._ -[Acts 1:8][act18] (NIV)
