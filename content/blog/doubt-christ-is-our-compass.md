**[Colossians 1:15-2:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians1:15-2:3)**

I used to love orienteering. With as little as a compass and sometimes a map, you would walk an unmarked course following instructions with direction and distance. The person/team closest to their finishing spot in the shortest amount of time was the winner. Unfortunately it was very easy to drift from your intended direction and find yourself completely in the wrong place. The best thing to do was to line up the direction you were to go based on your compass, find a spot in the distance and focus on it while counting out your paces. But it was easy to start doubting you had the right direction based on what was along your path.

The same goes for our walk with Christ. When we keep our eyes on Him we will not drift. The more we stay in fellowship with Him, we will end up where we are supposed to be for He will always lead us to Him. He is our compass pointing us in the right direction and the point in the distance on which we focus to walk straight. We are assured that with Him as our guide we will not drift from our goal.

The hardest part of orienteering was the obstacles in the way. All too often a tree was in the way which you would have to go around. It would slow you down because it wasn't an easy straight line. It could lead to a lot of doubt, causing your to drift off course, and eventually the wrong finishing line. When we follow Christ, keep our eyes on Him, and not doubt a miraculous thing happens. Even with obstacles in the way, we will reach our goal, we will finish the race, we will be winners.

**Questions**
1. You are going to a new place. What happens when you start doubting you are going in the right direction? What do you do if you get lost?
2. What helps when we begin to doubt that our walk with Christ is worth it?
3. What activities can we do to stay on track spiritually?
