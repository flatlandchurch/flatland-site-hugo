**[James 3:7-13][james]**

Let me start with a disclaimer; what I am writing doesn’t happen overnight. It takes effort and determination. What am I talking about? The words that come out of our mouth reflects something about us. Before committing ourselves to Christ, the words we use reflects the words that the world uses; crass, uncouth, and sometimes down right offensive. Those words become a deep seated part of our lives. But as Christians, we must find ourselves pointing people to Christ through everything we say--and by God‘s empowerment, we can.

When we turn our lives over to Christ, we abandon the standards of the world which include its thoughts and speach. Rather, we are to take on thoughts and words that are pure, kind, uplifting leaving behind those words that do not reflect Christ. Again, _this is not easy_. The change in us sometimes is slow and we may find ourselves using those words which are not Christlike. But we must put an effort into controlling our tongue by the power of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. We must avoid sources that reinforce those words that tear down the righteousness of God that lives in us. When we find ourselves using those words, we need to stop immediately and ask God to help grow us in Him.

[Jesus said][1], “A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.” As we move to the center of God, our lives will change. The words that came easily will become difficult simply because that is not who we have become. As we praise God and speak the Good News our tongue comes into congruence with our commitment to Him who saved us and is changing us.

> _May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer._ -[Psalms 19:14 NIV][2]
