[**Today's Reading: John 5:16-47 - Authority**][jhn5]

_“By the authority vested in me by the state of Nebraska…”_  
_“By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States…”_  
_“By virtue of such power and authority vested in me as King of New South Wales…”_

These are phrases heard around the world and across time in legal ceremonies and proceedings. The word vested means fully and unconditionally guaranteed as a legal right, benefit, or privilege.  The state, nation, or country has given an individual the power or legal right to make laws and proclamations.  These people received their authority through schooling, elections, or inheritance.  

When Jesus is persecuted by Jewish leaders for healing a crippled man on the Sabbath, he begins to explain his authority.  
* He did not do kind deeds or good works because they were good. He did not work because of his talent or ability or interest. He is working because his Father God is always working.  His work is God’s work.  
* Jesus gave new life to a man who had been lying there like a dead man, burdening everyone, for thirty-eight years. God the Creator is the source of life. Jesus gives spiritual life to sinners who are dead in their sins. 
* God gives Jesus the full right to judge. These Jews were judging Jesus using their own interpretation of the law as a standard. However, when they rejected Jesus’ words they brought judgment on themselves.

It is Jesus Christ, as God the Son, who is vested with the ultimate authority: the executor of God's judgment. As the Messiah of the Old Testament was prophesied to do, Jesus came to die for our sins. As the Old and New Testament both prophesy, Jesus will come once more, but this time to destroy everything that opposes his authority. He will sit in judgment of humanity and set up a new world in which he and those living in harmony with his authority will live forever.

> _“For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.”_ -[John 5:26-27][jhn5].
