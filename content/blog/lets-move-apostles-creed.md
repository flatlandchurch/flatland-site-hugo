[**Titus 1:1-4**][ti1]

Every believer is called to teach the Good News. We are called to teach the truth. Of course, that means we have to know the truth. There are only a few truths that we have to have in our arsenal in order to fulfill God's call on our lives. Our first source to learn the truth is of course, God’s Holy Word. There are several passages in Scripture that provide us what those fundamentals, for example, 1 Corinthians 15, Ephesians 2:1-10, and the “Roman Road” set of Scripture (see below). Learning these passages and memorizing key passages equip us to then teach.

Early in the Church's existance the leaders of the Church recognized that many people couldn’t read but they still could learn. They formulated several short, easily memorized passages known as creeds. One of the earliest found in many different forms is now known as the Apostle's creed. It was something short that everyone could memorize and then teach to others. Commonly it was recited during Sunday services so that believers would know the truth. Many hymns were written to do the same. They teach the foundational truths to our understanding of the Gospel.

It is important for us to remember that God does not call us and then leave us on our own. He gives us His Holy Spirit, He gives us His Word, and He gives us other believers who are gifted by the Holy Spirit to lead us. He has given us though those leaders easy to learn and remember teaching guides. Flatland Church has many of those resources [right on our website][flat]. We have no excuse, we may not know how yet, but when God calls He also equips, guides and instructs us. He leads us by the hand and provides family to support. He calls. Let's move!

> And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born of the Virgin Mary,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffered under Pontius Pilate,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was crucified, dead, and buried.   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day He rose again from the dead;   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty;   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.  
> I believe in the Holy Spirit;  
> The Holy Church universal,   
> the Communion of Saints;  
> The Forgiveness of sins;   
> The Resurrection of the body,  
> And the Life everlasting. Amen. -Apostle's Creed
