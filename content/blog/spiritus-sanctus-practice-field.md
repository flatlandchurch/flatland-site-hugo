[**1 Corinthians 14:26-33**][1]

One of the biggest reasons the world isn’t seeing more miracles being performed today is because many of us aren’t well versed/practiced in the administration of powerful Spiritual gifts. While the list of Spiritual gifts includes more than you may be able to recall, I offer a starting point. As a resource, we have an article “[Gifts of the Holy Spirit][article]” on Flatland Church’s website. These gifts are fairly well known, and they give us a good idea of how God wants to start using us in His desire to save the world.

You may have already received some or all of these gifts, but still aren’t seeing as many miracles in your life as you could. Quite possibly, the reason for this is that you’re not practicing as much as you could. Some questions around this idea include how does one practice and, even if I knew how, where could I go to get some practice?

Fortunately, as our Pastor pointed out on Sunday, here at Flatland we have many “Practice Fields” within the city of Omaha. We call them Life Groups. And they are the perfect place to go to get “practiced up” in administering the gifts of the Holy Spirit. At Flatland Church, we use Holy Scripture as our text (playbook). In this case, we look to [1 Corinthians 14:26-32][1] to see how practicing should be done. Keep in mind that practicing can look “messy” at times. But you can’t possibly know if you will ever do something well if you don’t set time aside to practice. We all need to learn from square one how to share Spiritual gifts. And Life Groups provide a safe environment where we’re not ashamed to say “I’m just not very good at this yet”. So go to your practice field. And then, earnestly set out to practice, walking closely in step with the Holy Spirit. Get to the point that you’re comfortable and confident using His amazing and powerful gifts and you’ll see that you use them anywhere you go as you miraculously gather others for Christ
