In [Colossians 4:7-18]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians4:7-18), Paul lists several names which mean little to many of us: Tychicus, Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, Justus, Epaphras, Luke, and Demas. These are all men with whom Paul was acquainted during his imprisonment in Rome. Paul was sending Tychicus and Onesimus to Colossae with his letter. He was sending greetings from the other men. In 4: 15-17 Paul mentions two additional people in Colossae, Nympha and Archippus, sending his greetings and instructions. 

The point in Paul telling us of all these people, was that they were part of his team. He had a team in Rome, and he had a team waiting in Colossae. He was not a one man show; he relied on his team to work together, share their struggles, encourage one another, pray together, and spread the good news together.  

It’s also interesting to note that Paul’s team consisted of men and women from different racial and socio-economic backgrounds, as well having different histories with Paul. Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus were Jews; the other men in Rome were Gentiles. Luke was a physician; Onesimus was a slave. Mark and Demas had both deserted Paul at one time. Nympha was a woman who hosted church in her home in Colossae. 

> [Colossians 3:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians3:11) _Here there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all and in all._ (NIV)

God has gifted every member of the body of Christ and expects us to use our gifts to serve Him. We are part of a team which includes men and women, all ages, all occupations, all races, all backgrounds, and even those who may have wronged us. 


**Questions:** 

1. How are you using your gifts to be a part of God’s team? 
2. Is your team limited to your own age group, or common earthly interests? 
3. When you have been wronged by a fellow Christian, can you still be on the same team?
