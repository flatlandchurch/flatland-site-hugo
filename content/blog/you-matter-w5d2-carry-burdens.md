#### [Galatians 6:1-10][1]
Ok, I have to admit, there are times when reading the Bible I get completely confused. The confusion is normally due to me bringing my own way of thinking to God’s way of thinking. [Paul says][2] God’s wisdom isn’t our own and I certainly think that is very true when it comes to reading Scripture. I bring a lot of garbage along with me when I am reading the Bible. Take Galatians 6:2 and Galatians 6:5. Doesn’t it seem like Paul is completely contradicting himself: “Carry each other’s burdens” and “each one should carry their own load.” What?

We really have to read those two phrases in the context of Galatians 6:1-10. As we read the whole passage we see there is a balance between the Body of Christ supporting one another and the individual’s responsibility for their own actions. It isn’t easy to live sin free but when supported by our Christian siblings, we can do it. We must take responsibility for our own actions, “a person reaps what they sow” but we also have the responsibility to help one another.

So, the confusion really comes down to this; “Am I going to take responsibility for my own actions? Do I have to? Do I have to be responsible to take the opportunity to ‘do good to all people’ and to ‘carry each other’s burdens’?” We fight with ourselves since rarely do we want to take responsibility for anything but that is exactly what Paul is saying. We can’t set ourselves up as being better than others, for we will certainly fail. But, in humility, we can support those in our family of believers who go through the same struggles that we go through. In doing this, we “will fulfill the [law of Christ][3].”

### Challenge
Read [John 13][4] asking yourself who do you need to show love to in the same way Jesus showed His love for us and the disciples that night?

> _A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that your are my disciples, if you love one another._ -John 13:34-35
