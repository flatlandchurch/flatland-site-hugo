**[Joshua 13-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua13-22)**

_"…then the land had rest from war"_ (Joshua 15:15).  Israel has had an incredible journey thus far in claiming the promises of God. God shows, as He always does, that His promises are perfectly good as He is perfectly good.  Of particular note at this point is the fact that Israel had been given the opportunity to claim this land of promise some 40 years ago.  We recall at that time that, despite God's promise of delivery, Israel fell short of laying claim to it.  And as a result, Israel has spent these past 40 years wandering about the desert enduring some pretty harsh living conditions.

Here in these chapters of our history, Israel has found renewed commitment to lay hold of the promises of God.  Their faith in God is now exemplary, as evidenced by their obedience to His direction, whether that direction makes sense from a human/logical standpoint or not.  Obedience to our Lord includes completing the tasks or instructions God has provided which enable them to take hold of the promises.  This requires perseverance through self-sacrifice (long-suffering) that only those of faith could endure. Without faith, we are tempted to turn away from our work and, thereby, claim for ourselves a pre-mature and undeserved rest.  Sadly, many doing so will never muster the motivation to return to such demanding work and thereby would not lay hold of the promise.

In paraphrasing the commandment for the Sabbath: Six days you may work, but on the seventh, you are to take rest…this is a day you are to devote to Me (the Lord).  Our 23rd Psalm reads, in part, "The Lord is my shepherd…He makes me to lay down…"  When the sheep have filled their bellies with the grasses of the field, the shepherd makes them lay down.  In this "dormant" state, the sheep are actually putting on fat and putting on wool. During this pause, they are literally growing from all they've taken in.  When we set aside a day of rest for ourselves and dedicate it entirely to the Lord, we're in a position to grow from all we've taken in of His blessings for the past six days.  Still, and perhaps especially in this day and age, we get the feeling that if we don't do some sort of work on our Sabbath, it's labeled a "wasted" day. It isn't.

**Questions**
1. Which day of the seven is your Sabbath?  On that day, do you feel the need to run to the office, clean the gutters, mow the lawn or run the kids frantically between extracurricular events?  How is your day of rest reflective of your devotion to the Lord?

2. If we feel antsy when resting quietly in the company of our Lord, could it be due to the feeling that we didn't actually complete our work assignment during the six days given us by Him?  Is it possible that what we're chasing has somehow fallen out of line with God's promises for us?  What do you imagine would result from waiting another 40 years to complete your work and claim your rest on His schedule?
