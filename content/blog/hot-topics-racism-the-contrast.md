In [Proverbs 6][pro6] Soloman describes a series of sins which are an abomination to the Lord.  In contrast, in his Sermon on the Mount ([Matthew 5][mat5]) Jesus delivers the Beatitudes, or a series of blessings.  Each blessing offers a future reward to the person possessing a specific character quality.

These contrasting scriptures describe two groups of people. On one side are those with a worldly viewpoint, the other godly. For example, God hates “haughty eyes”--someone who is arrogant, egotistical, or proud. That person is self-righteous, one who looks down on others as inferior. Jesus in contrast blesses “the meek”.

Another contrast; God hates the “person who stirs up conflict in the community” using gossip, lies, unfounded accusations, negative criticism, and backbiting to accomplish his goal. Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.”

Although the Bible teaches us that God is loving, His love does not overlook sin. Those who are corrupt are subject to sudden judgment, while those who follow in His footsteps are blessed and should rejoice for the great rewards they will receive in heaven.  Amidst today’s diverse culture and racial tensions, we are confronted with the same contrasts and are being told we have to belong to one, and in truth, we do. In which group do you belong?

> Read both passages and see how many other contrasting descriptions you can find. Allow God to speak to your heart and move you closer to Him and His ways.

> _Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven_ ~[Matthew 5:12][mat512]
