#### [Acts 2:42-47][1]
The early church set us an example, even a goal to achieve, “All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. ...And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.” Although the saying “money makes the world go round” goes overboard, the church and its ministries do require funds to provide for physical and spiritual needs. 

The more we are willing to participate in the daily activities of the church, both financially and through our abilities, God is able to work amazing things. Some of us are more able to provide financially, others through our skills but God calls us _all_ to give to Him _both_ ways. This is not out of duty, it it out of trust in God, that He will provide for us as well as those to whom we minister. When we refuse to give our tithes and talents, we declare our lack of faith in God to provide.

God doesn’t need our money, everything is His. But, the ministries He has called us to do does. Some ministries do not require money just our abilities but many do, especially when we need someone else to do it like missionaries or pastors. Our tithing and offerings provides the finances to do those ministries. We give so that others may fulfill the great commission. Oh wait! **We _all_ are called to fulfill the great commission.** Our giving helps us do that. Let’s heed the call. Let’s move.

### Challenge
Tithing is a challenge. It requires a lot of trust in God that He will take care of us. What is keeping you from trusting in God?
