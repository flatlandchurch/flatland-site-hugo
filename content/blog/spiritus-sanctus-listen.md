Here is a little secret, I don’t always write good blog posts. Oh, I suppose they are ok but they lack something important, the Holy Spirit. What I mean, I can easily type out a bunch of words that go well together and may even be persuasive. In a rush to get something out, I just write something and dash it off. But without listening to the Holy Spirit as I write, I have not written well, even if it was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.

No matter what ministry we are involved in, if we do not listen closely to Holy Spirit and act accordingly, we are simply going through the motions. Musicians can be professionals but without the Holy Spirit, they are making a bunch of noise. Preachers can expound on Scripture most profoundly but without the Holy Spirit’s hand, they are empty words. The greeter at the church door (or online host) can perfunctorily say hi and it is meaningless.

But when the greeter (or any other ministry) listens to the Holy Spirit as they minister to the Lord, we will be presented for great opportunity. That person walking in the door with a great big smile may have a heavy, heavy heart being shattered to little shards. The Holy Spirit can move you to stop what you are doing, reach out, and touch them. One might even have to grab someone else, asking them to take your place at the door, God will provide. At the prompting of the Holy Spirit your place is no longer at the door, it is with the person God would have you help.

Listening to the Holy Spirit goes beyond one of the “approved” ministries of the church, it goes to every day of life. A co-worker, a neighbor, a family member or friend, even that stranger in the grocery store, the Holy Spirit may prompt us to act but we won’t know if we are not listening. We are all called to be witnesses. The great part, listening to the Holy Spirit doesn’t just stop at hearing Him say “go” but the Spirit will then help us know what to say, when to say it, how to live it. Listen and see what God can do.

> _Teach me to do your will,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are my God.   
> May your gracious Spirit lead me forward    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a firm footing._ -Psalm 143:10
