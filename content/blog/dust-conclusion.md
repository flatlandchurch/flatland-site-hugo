#### [2 Tim 3:16-17][2tim]

We hope this series has encouraged you to read and study your Bible. The importance of reading Scripture can not be minimized. It is [God speaking to us][2pet] directly. He desires so much to have a close relationship with Him. He didn’t leave it up to random ideas but made sure everything was written down, guided by the Holy Spirit, breathing life into the words. He loves us so much.

Our response to that love is to love Him back. One of the ways to express our love for Him is to read and study what He painstakingly wrote. Another way to love God back is to then live those words. It is isn’t easy to live those words if we don’t know them. Paul told Timothy that Scripture equips us for living a Christian life. Scripture gives us the energy and know-how. God is greatly glorified, honored, and loved when we take the time and effort to read and learn His Word.

### Reflections
- How much do you really know about God?
- How much does God really want you to know about Him?
- How much do you really want to know about God?
