[**Exodus 1-11**][exodus]

The story of Moses’ early life is sorely lacking. We see him get born, rescued by Pharaoh’s daughter, and then suddenly he is 40 years old ([see Acts 7:23][acts7]). Based on the story in Exodus, Moses was raised in Pharaoh’s household and most likely well educated. Yet something was lacking, despite the luxury he was experiencing. He knew he was a Hebrew and so went out to “visit his own people.” That led to Moses doing the wrong thing for the right reason. He wanted to see his people free from their slavery. But he wasn’t ready.

Moses had to spend 40 years wandering around as a shepherd in the country of Midian to learn the skills that God needed him to know to lead the people of Israel. Although Moses had probably learned a lot in his first 40 years in the court of Pharaoh, that education was empty and not worth more than a passing reference in the Bible. Moses probably did learn reading, writing and arithmetic in Pharoh’s court which was beneficial but the worldly, haughty, self-centered education Moses also learned had to be unlearned as he led sheep around.

By the time Moses faced God in the burning bush, instead of a haughty prince of Pharaoh, he was a simple, humble shepherd who no longer felt he was worthy or capable of leading the Hebrews. At 80 years old, he may also have felt “too old” to lead, that was for someone else. God of course saw different. Moses was now ready to lead the people away from Egypt (spiritually Babylon). He would discover, much to his chagrin that they didn’t necessarily want to leave the benefits of Egypt despite their slavery. But he could and did lead them for 40 years, getting the next generation ready to take possession of the promised land.

It takes leadership to move others towards God and away from the slavery of Babylon. We all need someone. God also calls us to be disciple makers, to be someone to lead others closer to God. Timing is key, God’s timing. He will put us where and when we are needed, we need to but wait and watch. We won’t see a burning bush most likely but God will make it clear when and to whom we are called to be a Moses.

> _I will sing to the LORD,   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he has triumphed gloriously;  
> he has hurled both horse and rider   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the sea.  
> The LORD is my strength and my song;  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has given me victory.   
> This is my God, and I will praise him—   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my father’s God, and I will exalt him!_ -Exodus 15:1-2
