[**James 1:5-8**][1]

Today, James is calling on us to show our wisdom grit. Grit, loosely translated, means resolute stability when we’re tested. Metaphorically, it’s us being that immovable object withstanding the unstoppable force. Some of us may believe that we have less grit than others and, therefore, we aren’t expected to be resolute in the face of some of the challenges of life. I can’t speak for James or exactly how he would respond here, but isn’t that like thinking that God is stingy or has “shortchanged” you in some way? James calls on us to be smarter than that.

As part of the Jail Ministry Team, I pray for inmates who seem to believe that if they’re released, they’ll be in church every Sunday. I pray that they will align their heart with their mouth. I pray against the temptation to mix worldly thinking with godly wisdom. I pray against [double-mindedness.][2] While it’s easy to seek godly wisdom when we’re in some sort of bondage, once released, the force of worldly thinking comes at us and our resoluteness is tested. Recidivism in the correctional system is a huge problem as many, having experienced a season of relief, receive [nothing of lasting substance.][3]

“Wisdom, as James understands it, is the ability to live life well and make good decisions. Wisdom doesn’t come from old age or hard knocks. Wisdom begins with knowing and depending absolutely on God, who is never stingy when it comes to wisdom for those who seek it. He supplies all the wisdom we need when we ask. But when we try to go it alone — without God — trouble is around the corner. The key is that your request be anchored by your single-minded commitment to God. Those who depend only on their own judgment are like those lost on the seas, carried away by any wave or picked up by any wind. Those adrift on their own wisdom shouldn’t assume the Lord will rescue them or bring them anything. The splinter of divided loyalty shatters your compass and leaves you dizzy and confused.” (The Voice)

Do you feel like your seasons of relief are on a short chain? Are you anchored to the Lord in word while anchored to the world in thinking? Today, James is calling on you to get smart. You’ll still be tested, of that you can be sure. The good news is that Jesus fills us with wisdom grit when we ask and receive Him into our lives. Living out your professed faith in God’s wisdom is the only way to stand resolutely in all tests, yielding blessings everlasting. We have God’s promise on this.

> _By faith Abraham, when he endured God’s testing, offered his beloved son Isaac as a sacrifice. The one who had received God’s promise was willing to offer his only son;_ Hebrews 11:17 The Voice
