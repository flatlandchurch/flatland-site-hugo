In these closing chapters of [Joshua](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua23-24), God invites the Israelites to resolve their problems which have prevented them from pleasing Him and gives encouragement for them become productive members in His "business".  Like an earthly boss who rightly expects his or her expectations to be met so that our needs can be met, the Lord meets our needs under the conditions of the established agreement or covenant.  Of course, unlike any earthly boss, the Lord is infinitely and unconditionally faithful to keep His end of the covenant and bless us with the fulfillment of literally all of our needs.  And this is His desire; to keep the blessings flowing from Himself to us.

In just two short verses (Joshua 24:14-15), the Israelites are given an offer to (re)enter into a covenant with the same God who has proven, without exception, His desire and ability to fulfill His every promise.  On the part of the Israelites, this means worshipping no other god.  This "worship" includes their putting anything whatsoever before Him.  The Apostle Paul assures us that the same covenant and blessings are for us today.  Paul is careful to include the fact that our responsibility remains constant with each new generation (Colossians 3:5).  None of us can rest on the faithfulness of the patriarchs or even our own parents.  The offer stands for each one individually to accept or reject in accordance with the free will God has granted.  And, ultimately, the Promised-land of the Israelites, as good as it is, is just a foreshadowing of our Lord's eternal promises in Heaven.

**Questions**
1. Whom or what do you serve?  Have you ever caught yourself thinking "Yea, I need to get more committed to the Lord – and I will – as soon as…"?
2. What blessings are you missing out on today?  What idols do you need to throw away?  In other words, what now stands between you and putting absolutely nothing else before your relationship with God?
