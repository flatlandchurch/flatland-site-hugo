In [Mark 13][1], Jesus tells his disciples that only the Father knows the time of his return.  What, then, do we do in the meantime?

> Do the right thing even when no one is watching.

This is a quote displayed in the hallways of many schools, in an attempt to teach children accountability.  It is the definition of integrity.  We want children to walk on their way to the restroom, even if no teacher is present, to remain quiet if we need to step out in the hallway for a moment, to keep their hands to themselves and be kind to others, even when an adult is not watching.  They may find themselves unprepared when an adult shows up, and they are not doing the right thing.

If Christ returned today, would you be prepared?  Would you be doing the right thing?  Or would you be ashamed or embarrassed about what you're doing in that moment? If so, you are not living in a way that is pleasing to him; you are not living in integrity with God. Christ charges us to be watchful and ready for his return.

> _Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming—in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning—  lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!_  Mark 13:35-37


### Questions:

1. If Christ returned tomorrow, would you be prepared?  If not, what steps can you take to stay in integrity with God?
2. Are you anxiously awaiting His return, or are you anxious about the end of your life as you know it?  Can you anticipate Christ in the same way you look forward to a visit from another loved one?
