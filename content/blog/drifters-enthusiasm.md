**[Colossians 1:1-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians1:1-14)**

Our current series is called Drifters. It is a call to follow Paul's call, “But you must continue to believe this truth and stand firmly in it. Don’t drift away from the assurance you received when you heard the Good News.” Colossians‬ ‭1:23‬ ‭NLT‬‬. We have a concept at Flatland about moving towards the center, moving closer to God. The opposite is to drift away from Him.

Having enthusiasm regarding our salvation is a sure guard against drifting. I was reminded once again how we need to be enthusiastic about serving God while watching the youth of Flatland bounce in praise. I once was that teen but after 55+ years of being a Christian I wondered if I lost that enthusiasm. Being a grumpy old Christian saying "we didn't do that in my day" throws water on the fire **but** seeing them bounce in praise brought a huge smile to my face and an uplift to my heart. I may not be able to bounce physically but I certainly can let my spirit soar.

Paul at the start of his letter to Colossae prays that they grow in the knowledge of God, be strengthened, and give joyful thanks to the Lord, Colossians 1:10-12. The more enthusiastic we are regarding the Lord, the more we will grow in that knowledge, the stronger we will get, and we will certainly be bouncing with joy to the Lord.

**Questions**
1. What can we do to stoke our enthusiasm for the Lord?
2. What can discourage us causing us to drift and how do we fight it?
3. Think of someone you can share your enthusiasm for the Lord.
