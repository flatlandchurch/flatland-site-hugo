[**Titus 3:12-15**][1]

Some time back I read an article about a man who won big in the lottery. Before he cashed in on the ticket, he divorced his wife and virtually disowned his friends in attempt to keep all the money to himself. This idea was so foreign to me that I couldn’t relate in any way and I was even having a hard time accepting this story as fact. I couldn’t imagine having enough wealth for several lifetimes, but having no one with whom to share the experiences of it.

Sadly, this is the attitude of some so-called Christians when it comes to the salvation that they never had to work for. They hide it from everybody. Jesus rarely, if ever, comes up while their friends are around. And, in some cases, spouses don’t even pray together on anything resembling a regular basis. And the last thing they could imagine in their self-centered minds is spreading their salvation out for the benefit of others.

Salvation is of infinite value. By definition, we can’t lose any of its value by sharing. Therefore, we who are saved should desire above all things to spread salvation out to every living person. Imagine what could be done with a greater workforce. Becoming a true disciple of Jesus is the only way to encourage discipleship in others. And making disciples is the only way to spread the Word to the ends of the earth.

Imagine a world where no one gets left behind. To say I’m genuinely vested in Jesus means that I genuinely love to share. It means that I love knowing that I have my time, talent, and treasure invested in His kingdom.

> _No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a washtub or shoves it under the bed. No, you set it up on a lamp stand so those who enter the room can see their way. We’re not keeping secrets; we’re telling them. We’re not hiding things; we’re bringing everything out into the open. So be careful that you don’t become misers of what you hear. Generosity begets generosity. Stinginess impoverishes._ -Luke 8:16-18 MSG
