The resurrection is the foundation of Christianity. Without it, our belief is in vain. Paul writes to the church in Corinth “And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.” [1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:14][1]‬ But [Paul says][2] that the resurrection of Jesus is real. It is a historical event.

The resurrection gives us hope. We don't have a bleak future. A future that ends with our death. The movie Coco is all about the day of the dead where every one remembers their ancestors. The dead rely on being remembered to exist. If no one remembers them then they disolve away. It is a dreadful outlook on life that eventually we just disolve away into nothingness.

But our eternity isn't dependent on how we are remembered or what we have done or how good we have been. The resurrection is the seal on our salvation. It is the promise we have for eternity. Our eternity is in God’s love.

> _“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”-[John‬ ‭3:16][3]‬

### Reflection
On what do you pin your hope? Your own accomplishments? On God's accomplishments, the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ?
