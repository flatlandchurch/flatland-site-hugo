Many of us procrastinate.  We wait until the last minute, then cram to get things done.  Sometimes we meet the deadline in the nick of time and all is well.  We clean the house minutes before company arrives. We complete a project an hour before it is due.  We rush the trash to the curb when we see the garbage truck coming up the hill.

Other times our procrastination may result in dire, or at least undesirable consequences.  We put off ordering a tux for a special event, and when we get around to it, a suitable tux isn’t available.  We miss the deadline for applying to a college, and end up settling for second best, or worse. The consequences become dire when we put off seeking medical attention for an ailment, which becomes life-threatening when treatment is prolonged. 

The more important the task, the more undesirable, or even dire, the consequences may be if we procrastinate.  Our most important task is God’s intention for us.  He wants us to choose Him, to pick up the cross and follow Jesus, to live holy lives.  God is patient.  He wants all His children in His kingdom.  But that does not mean the procrastinator gets a pass.  We cannot live according to our own will, with a plan to choose Him just in time.  We must be perpetually ready, and exercise patience as He does for us.  In the meantime, the joyful presence of the Holy Spirit resides in us during our stay on Earth.

> _"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father... Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with the hand mill; one will be taken and the other left...Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come"_ -[Matthew 24:36, 40, 42][1].

**Task**:  If you keep a calendar of appointments and deadlines, highlight the tasks which will have dire consequences if not completed on time.  Add the following scripture to the top of each month and highlight it:  
> _Be watchful, stand firm in the faith...be strong._ -[1 Corinthians 16:13][2]
