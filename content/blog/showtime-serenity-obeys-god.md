#### [James 4:11-12][1]

In Jesus’ day, tax collectors, thieves, murderers, and adulterers were considered the worst of the worst – unlovely and unlovable. Today, we may think of people as unlovely for different reasons. I may think I can’t love someone who betrayed my trust or someone who drove after drinking and hurt someone. And, no matter what, even though our marriage is over and we’ve gone our separate ways, I could never harbor the slightest love for my ex.

Under our own power and reasoning, all of the above is true. But Jesus has come that we may be filled with His power and love, if we only accept Him. We need to know that Jesus’ love for us is real. He’s not some tyrant looking to set us up to fail. Jesus would never give us an assignment without the tools to fulfill it. When He gives us the commandment to love all people – right where they are – He knows He’s going to empower us with the Holy Spirit to accomplish the lion’s share of the loving.

Once we step out in obedience to the commandment, or once we make an intentional choice to love – even the unlovely, we’re miraculously empowered to be the fully equipped hands of Jesus in doing everything He wants done. Jesus didn’t wait until he felt better to forgive, [He forgave while he was still in agonizing pain.][2] Being a genuine disciple of Jesus means that we follow Him obediently. Being Christian means we’re not looking for “worldly loopholes” in attempt to ease our conscience when choosing not to obey Jesus in particularly difficult situations. We don’t suffer the anxiety and worry about someone getting away with something. On the contrary, disciples of Jesus find absolute satisfaction and serenity in the knowledge that we got away with every punishment we deserve just because Jesus loves us. And we sincerely want nothing more than the serenity of operating in obedience to Jesus, sharing our unlimited supply of grace with every single person in great need of it.

### Reflections
- What would it be like for you to approach your boss when you know you’ve been cutting corners at work? Wouldn’t you feel ill at ease?
- With whom are you “cutting love corners”? Take time in all circumstances, even right now, to reflect on how you approach the throne of God as you pray.

> _A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you **must** love one another. By this everyone (including you) will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another._ John 13:34-35 NIV
