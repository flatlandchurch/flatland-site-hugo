[**Genesis 47, 49-50**][1]

In our reading today, we see God’s unconditional blessing. Joseph has been “sent” to Egypt ahead of his family to be blessed by God. Because of his unfailing faithfulness to God, he has become the most powerful man in Egypt - indeed the known world - second only to the Pharoah. Under Joseph’s leadership, Egypt produces and stores food in exceeding abundance. Now, as famine strikes, Egypt alone is found to have food enough to feed all who seek help. Through His faithful servant Joseph, God blesses the known world.

As people spend their money to its end for food, notice that God doesn’t forsake them. Read for yourself how God uses Joseph to bless them, despite being destitute in the midst of famine. Notice, for example, how the world is included in God’s blessings by virtue of association with His faithful. This still applies today. Believers and non-believers alike reap unconditional blessings of God because of our faithfulness to Him.

Now to the matter of Joseph’s brothers who sold him into slavery. Once their father dies, they know that there’s nothing in the world to restrain Joseph’s justice upon them. He holds absolute authority, and has certainly not forgotten what they did. See what happens to these men and how their fate is a direct consequence of Joseph’s faithfulness to God.

> _and from your descendants all the peoples of the earth will discover true blessing. All this is because you have obeyed My voice._ Genesis 22:18 The Voice
