#### [Romans 15:1-13][rom15]

Our family network puts us on a major roller coaster of emotions. Unfortunately, we can’t get off until we get to meet the Lord. Fortunately, the Lord is right there with us on the ride to help us as we live this crazy life. Maybe one of the most important things that we can think about when were on that ride, Jesus has already lived it. He knows what we are going through and is right there to help us. As such, we are called to have the [same attitude][phi] that Christ had. It is an attitude of servanthood.

When we place the needs of others above our own, working for their good and not trying to get our own way the roller coaster seems to become less crazy. It is not easy but Paul says to accept one another just as Christ accepted you. Think about that. Think about where you were and how far you have come because Christ accepted you, making you one of his family. There are things that are just not right with others in our family, things we would like to see changed. But we must love others, just as Christ loved us and not make those “wrong” things a bone of contention or something to be fixed.

We must be strong and be examples to those who are weak, bearing with the “problems” of others. We must rely on the endurance and encouragement that God gives so that even when the rollercoaster takes a sudden and long fall, we may praise God giving Him the glory. As we trust God to take care of things, our hope in Him will not fail. God will fill us with joy and peace. Let’s move.

### Challenges
- How do the knowledge of Christ and gifts from the Father help us with the emotional rollercoaster of family relationship?
- What does it look like for you to trust in Him with regard to your family this week?
- What will you do this week?

> _Make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus._ -Philippians 2:2-5
