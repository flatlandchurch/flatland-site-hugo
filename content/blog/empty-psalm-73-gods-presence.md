[**Psalm 73**][1]

It is always amazing how confused one can get when we try to figure things out on our own. We hear the news, look under the hood of the car, or try to use a computer and our heads just spins. Worse, we look around and see rich and powerful people getting away with all kinds of evil and one can scream how unfair it is. Why should we be good and honest? Why work hard and feel like we are barely getting by? Why be followers of Christ when life seems to throw misery at us?

Paul says there are two types of wisdom, the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God (see [1 Corinthians 2][2]). The problem arises when we listen to the world’s wisdom. It brings a deep feeling of emptiness. But, as the psalmist says, when we enter into God’s presence and allow Him to overwhelm us with His wisdom, we suddenly feel foolish for ever thinking that the world’s wisdom was anything but foolishness. We are full of life in  Christ.

We need to daily seek God’s wisdom, His love, and His power. We do it not out of obligation or ritual. We do it because God and only God can give us the peace, hope, and power to live our daily lives. We should be like David and say

> _As the deer pants for streams of water,_  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_so my soul pants for you, my God._  
> _My soul thirsts for God, for the living God._  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_When can I go and meet with God?_  -[Psalm 42:1][psa42]
