### [Philippians 1][1]

How often have you started something and not completed it?  Started a book and got bored with it; started a project and didn’t find the time to finish it; had a great idea for a business prospect but didn’t have the confidence to try it; found some cool ideas on Pinterest, meant to do them but never followed through…How often?  We sometimes lack the motivation, time, or confidence to see things through to fruition.  But we can always count on God, who will complete the good work he began in us.   He does not become bored, he is not too busy, he is not afraid.  He started the work, and He will finish it.  

Christ began a good work in us when he died on the cross.  This good work began in each of us when we accepted Christ.  And while salvation begins at that moment of acceptance, the process of becoming more like Christ is a process.  The assurance of our sanctification is grounded in the work of Christ.  

> _He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus._  Philippians 1:6

### Questions: 

1. How does the knowledge that God will complete His work in you encourage you to persevere this week? 
2. What does Paul mean by “until the day of Christ Jesus”?
