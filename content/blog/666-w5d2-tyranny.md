#### [Revelation 12-15][1]
Satan really hates us who believe, really. He doesn’t care one whit about non-believers. They can do whatever they want because whatever it is, it won’t be for God. On the other hand, the devil will try everything he can to thwart our walk with Christ. He wants us to move, just not to the center but away from the center to outside the circle.

[Peter said it this way][2], “Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.” Peter isn’t talking to non-believers. They have nothing to fear at this time. Now come the Tribulation, that is when the Tyrant Dragon will rage against the world because he finally gets it, he lost, we are untouchable. But for now, he will do everything he can against us.

[Peter says][3], “Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of suffering.” [James says][4] “Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” Satan has no real power against us. He only has lies to try to draw us away from God. But when we resist him, [God][5] “will Himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.” We don’t go it alone. The Holy Spirit empowers us and our fellow believers support and build us up. He may be a tyrant but his threats against us are empty. Resist! Let’s Move to the Center!

### Challenge
Time to review your testimony. 
- What led you to Christ? 
- Why do you believe? 
- What makes living for Christ great?
