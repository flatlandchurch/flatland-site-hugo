#### [Luke 6:38][1]
 
If you’ve ever tried to do something you weren’t qualified for, you know how frustrating and unsuccessful such an endeavor can be. On the other hand, if you’ve been assigned jobs that don’t meet your potential, you can be miserably unsatisfied in your work. Therefore, in life, we find that our most satisfying experiences come from doing what we have been prepared to do. It’s no stretch at all then to know that human beings are most fulfilled when we’re doing exactly what we we’re created to do.

Years ago, president Kennedy challenged all Americans in his inaugural speech by declaring that we should “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country”. So, it’s completely understandable if you find it counterintuitive when I say you should ask not what giving can do for others; you should ask what giving can do for you.

As we’re most fulfilled when we’re doing exactly what we’re created to do, we should be mindful that [we are created in the image and likeness of a God][2] who is always giving. When we actively participate in giving, we literally experience a share in the image and likeness of the most-high God. We can try anything and everything else, but this personal fulfillment/edification can’t be artificially reproduced. Let’s face it, God doesn’t need our money. After all He’s got more money than “you-know-who”. It’s we who have the need to give. Giving generously makes us godly.

### Challenges
- Finish this sentence: “I’ll start tithing (more) as soon as God blesses me with...”
- In your prayers, ask God if you need your script flipped. Ask Him if He’s been saying all along “I have already prepared abundant blessings to share with those who step out in faith and follow me”.

> _So, two good things will result from this ministry of giving — the needs of the believers in Jerusalem will be met, **and** they will joyfully express their thanks to God.  As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God. For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ._ 2 Corinthians 9:12-13 NLT
