### [Philippians 4:1-5][1]

We miss something as we all drive to Sunday morning services that I can imagine was magnificent at times. In King David's day, the people of Israel would of course walk to "church". As they did, they would wind their way up the hill to the tabernacle singing. We have some of the songs they sang in the Psalms as indicated by the subtitle of "A song of ascents". Think about it, thousands of people walking together all singing the various songs together. The city would have been ringing with praise to God.

Now it would have been a real cacophony if they had all been singing different songs at the same time. Joe over there singing Psalm 124 while Mike right behind praising God with Psalm 125 and each family before or behind choosing their own Psalm. Oh the noise! But instead I imagine that one family would start singing one song and everyone else would join in with them. The joyous sound rising over the city would have been glorious. 

If we all try to do our own thing, if we clash with others, [it would lead to a real disaster][2]. Unity in the church leads to marvelous things. Paul goes so far as to plead with two leaders in the church at Philippi to be of the same mind because of this. He would agree with Peter that unity in the church is important "so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ." (see [1 Peter 4:7-11]) When we work together for the Lord mighty things will be done and become beautiful music in God's ears. 

> How good and pleasant it is
> &nbsp;&nbsp;when Godâ€™s people live together in unity!
> ...
> For there the Lord bestows his blessing,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;even life forevermore. Psalm 133
