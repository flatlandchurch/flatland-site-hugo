[**Genesis 37-50**][1]

Excuses...we all make them.  “I’ll start my diet as soon as the holidays are over.”  “I’ll look for a new job once I see if I get the promotion I’ve been hoping for for five years.”  “I’ll make an effort to keep in touch with my old friends after this busy season slows down.”  “I’ll practice spiritual disciplines more, pray more, go to church more, tithe, serve in a ministry, as soon as…”

What’s your excuse?  If anyone had an excuse, it was Joseph.  Betrayed over and over again, sold out, wronged, cheated, tore down...no one seemed to be on his side.  He could have said, “I’ll have faith as soon as I get back my life that was stolen from me, when I’m treated fairly, when I get out of prison…”  But Joseph’s faith prevailed through his suffering.   Instead of waiting for God’s favor, he served God in spite of seemingly receiving no favor.  It turned out God had a divine purpose for him, and had Joseph not accepted the difficult path he was sent on, he never would have realized his purpose.  Joseph kept his eyes on God, and God used Joseph right where he was, on every step of his path, right up to his glorious reunion with his brothers.

> _For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons._ ~[Romans 8:14-15][2]
