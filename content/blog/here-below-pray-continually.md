[The Parable of the Persistent Widow][1] concludes as Jesus poses this question to his disciples: _But when the Son of Man returns, how many will He find on the earth who have faith?_   -[Luke 18:8][9]

Jesus wants his kingdom here below to practice continued devotion to prayer as a way of life.  We are to “pray without ceasing” ([1 Thessalonians 5:17][2]).

“Without ceasing” implies that we never stop.  How can we pray without ceasing?

* _Rejoice in the Lord always._ -[Philippians 4:4][3]    
Practice a heart attitude of joyful thanksgiving.  Express it throughout the day with silent prayers.

* _For we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words._ -[Romans 8:26][4]    
Stay in constant communication with God, so when the Spirit moves you to pray, you can instantly agree with Him.

* _Praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication._ -[Ephesians 6:18][5]    
Stay open to the leading of the Spirit when He urges you to pray for something or someone; while driving, mowing the lawn, working…

* _Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed._  -[James 5:16][6]     
Surround yourself with other believers; pray together and let your prayers strengthen each other.

* _But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you._  -[Matthew 6:6][7]     
Build your relationship with God by spending time alone with Him in prayer.

> _Rejoice always, 
> pray without ceasing, 
> in everything give thanks;
> for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you._  -[1 Thessalonians 5:16-18][8]
