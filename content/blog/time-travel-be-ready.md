Just about every time the coming of the Lord is referenced in Scriptures, a main theme crops up, "be ready."  The corollary follow-up to this is the need to "stand firm" but that is a topic for another day.

Being "ready" at first glance appears to be just having a sense of attentiveness while we wait for the Lord to return, for example see [Matthew 24:36-51][1], [Luke 12:35-40][2], and [Titus 2:11-14][3].  However, as one can see in the verses mentioned, this readiness was never intended to have believers just sitting around doing nothing but staring at the heavens. Our readiness includes daily preparation as evidenced by our service to others and by getting control over our thoughts and actions. Peter said it this way, "Therefore, with your minds ready for action, be serious and set your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." - [1 Pet. 1:13 (HCSB)][4]

Even though Jesus clearly told us that we will not know when He will return, certain people, otherwise known as false prophets, have convinced ignorant followers to waste their time, efforts, and resources on empty promises. There is an entry in Wikipedia titled, "Predictions and claims for the Second Coming of Christ." It includes over 40 people or groups falsely predicting His return dating from 500 AD all the way to June 6, 2019.  Some of these folks even made multiple predictions, presumably when their initial predictions failed.  It then includes another 6 predictions for future dates ranging from 2020 to 2057.  Of course, this list is by no means all inclusive.

Rather than simply touting that the Lord is Coming, we should be showing our readiness for His return by living for Him in the here and now.

> _“If anyone tells you then, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Over here!’ do not believe it! False messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. Take note: I have told you in advance. So if they tell you, ‘Look, He’s in the wilderness!’ don’t go out; ‘Look, He’s in the inner rooms!’ do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."_ -[Matthew 24:23-27][5] (HCSB)
