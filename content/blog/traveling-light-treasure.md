[Luke 12:22-34][1]

“Do not worry…” (v22).  Jesus knows that, as humans, we need continuous reminder of His teaching.  Here, once again, He reminds us that what we consider treasure on earth is nothing but moth feed and future rust.  Only that treasure which we put in heaven is eternal.  Only in heaven will our treasure be spent on eternal lavishness and never depleted.  But, if our hearts are set upon the earth and the things of it, we are living under the burden of worry of losing that which we hold dear.

Driving around Omaha, we can see one business in particular that is growing; the storage unit business.  These are great when one is between homes, but this business’ growth reflects that these units have become part of normal life in many cases.  How many of us wish we could “upgrade” to a bigger home, but know full well that, after we get that bigger home, we will fill it with stuff and be just as cramped as before?  Once the great symbol of everlasting commitment, how many of our parents and grandparents would even think of discarding their wedding sets?  Today, these symbols are tossed across counters at local jewelers as mere trade for “upgrades” as a show to the world that our status has “improved”.

Whether home, car, jewelry, clothing, food or anything else, Jesus tells us to sell so as to “downsize” so we may be freed to travel light. Sell your possessions (so that you can) give to the poor (v33) is not intended to be interpreted as “become absolutely homeless”, but better translated as “eliminate that which is superfluous”.  In this way, we lose nothing.  On the contrary, we are empowered to be generous (God-like), thereby storing up our treasures in Heaven.  V34: “For, where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”.

> _Do not wear yourself out to get rich;_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_do not trust your own cleverness._
> _Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone,_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_for they will surely sprout wings_
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_and fly off to the sky like an eagle._ -[Proverbs 23.4-5][2] NIV

### Question
1. Where is your treasure?  What does this say about your heart?

### Action
This week, as you go about your home, see if you can notice things which you have a heart for that are superfluous.  Is God gently nudging you to recognize that these things are actually a burden against freeing up your concern to be placed in Him alone?
