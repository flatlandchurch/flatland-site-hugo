[**1 Thessalonians 5:9-11**][1] 

Covid-19 is definitely a hot topic.  But how did a virus get to be such a hot topic.  Well, we have different views on the odds of survival. Those who think the odds of surviving Covids-19 are better than surviving the flu hold a much different view from those who believe contracting the virus is tantamount to a death sentence.  Those who think masks will keep us safe hold a different viewpoint from those who think that masks make about as much sense as putting up a chain-link fence to keep mosquitos out of your yard. Some seem to believe that having 100 extra rolls of toilet paper in their house is the modern-day equivalent to lamb’s blood on their lintel; that somehow [the plague will just pass over their household.][2]  In this case, the “haves” and the “have nots” are at odds.  And the list goes on.

Having different viewpoints is good.  This is how God created us and it’s meant for us to come together and collaborate in order to come up with new ideas and solve problems, including reasonably safe practices.  But, when we allow our different viewpoints to cause division amongst us, we fall out of God’s plan and His graces.  In this case greater problems, compounded by fear, can not only be possible, they’re to be expected.

Since God created us in His image and likeness, we need to keep laser-focused on what we all have in common. One of the most obvious is that we will absolutely pass from this life into our eternal home.  Therefore, one question we need to answer for ourselves is: “Am I ready to go live with Jesus?” Don’t get me wrong, I’m not sitting here hoping to die today any more than my wife was hoping for labor pains.  But, like my wife who was ready because she prepared for the inevitable, I am ready because I have prepared for the inevitable.  I have accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior, and He can call me home any time He sees fit.  As Christians, we’re called to be ready at all times and to bring others into this blessed assurance.  [Then peace will fill our hearts and minds.][3]

Do you think those experiencing the most anxiety have prepared for the inevitable?  Why or why not?

> _For God chose to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his anger on us. Christ died for us so that, whether we are dead or alive when he returns, we can live with him forever. So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing._ 1 Thessalonians 5:9-11 (NLT)
