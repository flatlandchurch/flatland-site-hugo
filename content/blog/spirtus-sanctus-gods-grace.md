[**1 Peter 4:7-11**][1pe4]

Peter in his first letter writes something that should wake us up, “The end of all things is near. Therefore....” There is that word, “therefore”, the word when we read it we need to ask ourselves, “What is ‘therefore’ there for?” It basically is a clue, what comes next is all based on what just came before it. Well, the statement “The end of all things is near” is the context of what Peter is going to say next, which to simplify, is this, “Get off your duff and get busy doing for the Lord.”

Peter is pretty clear, we are to get busy doing for one simple reason, we are God’s hands, feet, voice, ears, and every other part of the Body. We are called to do “so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ.” We are called to do that things might get done (duh!). Now God didn’t just crack the whip and say “Do it!” God first equips us the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which Peter equates to God’s grace in action. Yes, when we are being used by the Holy Spirit through the gifts we are physical representations of God’s grace to everyone.

We are not to go through the motions of “serving” in the Church. We are to take up the gifts God has provided us through the Spirit and use them with everything we have. We need to get the urgency in our step, in our voice, in our desire because we know, “The end of all things is near.” Here is one little thing to think about, if Peter said “The end of all things is near” in his day, how much more true is is now, Christ’s return could be today. So let us get off our duffs and get busy doing.

> _If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen._ -1 Peter 4:11
