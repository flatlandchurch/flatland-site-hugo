Paul encourages us to live a life worthy of our calling ([Ephesians 4:1][1]). But to live worthy we need to know what our calling is. Paul seems to assume we know what that calling is so never quite tells us. Or does he? Our calling is to live lives that reflect Christ and proclaim Christ. [Chapter 4 of Ephesians][1] is an instruction pamphlet for how to live our calling.

Many make the mistake to think that the calling refers to some special ministry like being a pastor or missionary. Yes, that is a calling... well no. Those are gifts of the Holy Spirit which Christ bestows on us. _This is key_, the gifts of the Spirit are many and varied. [We are _all called_ to be used by the Spirit][2] to build up the Body of Christ, that is the Church and for us specifically, Flatland Church in Omaha Nebraska. Our calling is to be used by God in whatever gifts He has bestowed be it a pastor, a greeter, or someone who cleans the church's toilets. Christ has also called us all to be witnesses to the world. It is the one specific call upon us all (see [Matthew 28:19-20][3], [1 Peter 3:15][4])

We need to hear, understand, and live the calling we have been given, to live like Christ. We are to minister to one another in humility, gentleness, and patience. We are called to proclaim the good news that the lost might be found. This is Christ’s life and the one to which we are called.

> _Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him and he will do this..._
> _Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him_ -[Psalms‬ ‭37:5, 7‬ ‭NIV][5]‬‬
