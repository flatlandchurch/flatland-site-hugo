In [Mark 9][1], Peter, James, and John experienced an incredible moment on a mountaintop.  Jesus shone in all his glory, with three heavenly witnesses:  Moses, Elijah, and the voice of God.  The Old Testament law of three witnesses required to attest to any fact (Deuteronomy 19: 15) was satisfied in both earth and heaven, and the three disciples had their "mountaintop moment".  

Many people in the bible experienced mountaintop moments, literally on a mountain.  Abraham demonstrated his faith on a mountain, Moses received the ten commandments on a mountain, Elijah met God on a mountain.  We can have mountaintop moments anywhere.  It's those moments when we feel God's presence and His work in our lives.  It may be a song, a retreat we attended, a sermon that hit home for us, perhaps a vision or a dream, or a time when a prayer was answered.  

The three disciples didn't stay on the mountain, nor did their predecessors in the Bible.  They followed Jesus down the mountain, and continued to experience transforming moments elsewhere.  These moments can be incredible, life-changing; perhaps one of these moments led you to initially follow Christ.  Remember them, cherish them… but don't become stuck in them.  If we become stuck in that song, that one Bible study author that seemingly wrote to you, that one vision that may never happen again… we could miss out on something new Jesus has for us. Follow Jesus down that mountain and continue to seek Him.  That moment may never happen again, but if we are faithful there will be other mountaintops.   

> _Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"_ [John 11:40]

Questions: 

1.	We may become frustrated when our mountaintop moment is over and we don't experience it again, or we don't experience those moments witnessed to us by others.  What mountain can you climb next, and can you keep your eyes and heart open to what Christ has to show you? 
2. What will you do to witness to others that they may become witnesses of our mountaintop momement?
