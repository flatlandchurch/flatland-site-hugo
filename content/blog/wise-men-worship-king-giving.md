I often joke about tithing with the line, “Pass the hat and call the undertaker.” This refers to&mdash;as many of you will recognize&mdash;the story we read in [Acts 5][act5]. A couple named Ananias and Sapphira sold a piece of property and brought part of the proceeds to the church. Surprise, surprise, they fall over dead. Like wow! Tithing and offerings can be deadly. The problem was simple, they gave not to worship God, not to provide for the people in the assembly, but for some other reason. They lied, apparently saying this is how much we sold the property and _we are giving it all_. They had wrong motives for giving. God took this opportunity to teach us very vividly that giving is not something to take lightly.

Just before the story in chapter 5 we see [another story][act4] of another person who sold a piece of property and brought it to the church. They guy was named Joseph but the Apostles named him Barnabas because it means “son of encouragement.” What he did in worship to God provided some very tangible encouragement to the people. My guess, Ananias and Sapphira saw this praise given to Barnabas and said, “I want that recognition.” Their motive to give had nothing to do with God and His people, their motive was to get.

Paul helps us understand how God wants us to give, “Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” -[2 Corinthians 9:7][2co9] I think this is what Peter is trying to tell Ananias when [he says][act5], “While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal?” The amount of money isn’t important, _why_ we are giving is. We have the choice of how much to give. We shouldn’t try to lie to ourselves and to God about that choice. Giving is a matter of [trust][proverbs3] and worship of the Almighty God. Let us worship.

> _But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand._ [1 Chronicles 29:14][1ch29]
