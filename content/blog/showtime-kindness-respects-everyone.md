[James 2:1-13][1]

Feeling someone’s pain, as the saying goes, doesn’t come naturally.  When we first come into this world, we’re only capable of discerning our own needs. In fact, when we’re hungry, need a diaper change, or just plain bored and want attention, we’re extremely impolite and demanding. As we become toddlers, our social skills begin to develop. At this point, we learn to use words like _please_ and _thank you_, but we’re just mimicking what we’ve been told; we’re being more compliant than respectful of others. Then, as we mature, we develop the capacity to feel respect for others, but this development isn’t something that just happens automatically. Therefore, it’s hard to respect some people, let alone all people.

When Jesus comes into our lives, He solves this problem. He takes us out of slavery of every kind – sin, ignorance, selfishness, etc. – into freedom in Christ. He paid the ransom that takes us from serving evil, yielding our own demise, to serving God, yielding rewards eternal.

[1 John 3:1][2] explains that we mere humans are now royalty; children of the King of all kings. Whether or not you have children of your own, think for a moment how you would feel if a “friend” said he or she loves you, but can’t stand one of your kids. Since flawed humans can understand how impossible it would be to favor one child over another, think about the impossibility of our perfect Father favoring one child over any other.

James reminds us of our Father’s perfect love for each of His children without limit or exception. He warns us against thinking anyone, including ourselves, is due more or less love and respect. Whether we treat the rich and famous with respect and the poor with disdain, or we simply show a lesser level of respect toward one who has failed us, we’re showing sinful favoritism and God detests this in us. James illustrates that [Jesus’ commandment of unconditional love, which set us free, is violated each time we fail to love unconditionally.][3] We’re commanded to [love, in the exact same manner as Jesus loves us.][4] When we do, [we show ourselves – and the world –][5] the salvation that we claim to have when we call ourselves Christ-like or Christian.

My dear brothers and sisters, how can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favor some people over others?_ James 2:1 NLT
