The story of Joseph is the longest story of an individual in Genesis. It had a major impact on the people of Israel. Joseph undergoes a lot trials, hated by his older 10 brothers, sold into slavery, and thrown unjustly into jail. Yet despite the trials he was going through, in the middle of his problems, he still trusted God. Because of his faith, God blessed him so that right there in the middle of slavery, right in the middle of being in jail, he became a home of influence. Yes, a person of one can be a home of influence.

Joseph had an amazing amount of faith. He believed that where he was in life was exactly where God wanted him. As such, Joseph could be a blessing to those around him _and he was._ The culmination of the story come when Joseph is the second most powerful person in Egypt. His brothers come to him during a famine to get some food so they might live. They don't recognize him, after all, they think he is either a slave or dead. When he finally reveals himself to them they have to be terrified but he makes an amazing statement, “don't be afraid... because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.... But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.” ([Genesis‬ ‭45:5, 7‬ NIV][1])

Joseph started out to be a home of influence of one but because of his faith in God, because he remained true to God, he is made great. His home of influence becomes not only one tribe of Israel but two, mighty and awesome. _Our homes can be homes of influence_ despite of and in the midst of trials and tribulations when we remain steadfast in our faith and believe that we are right where God wants us. We will bring God's blessings to those around us.

> _Trust in the LORD with all your heart_   
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lean not on your own understanding;_
> _in all your ways submit to him,_
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he will make your paths straight._

-[Proverbs‬ ‭3:5-6‬ ‭NIV‬‬][2]
