I have 329 friends on Facebook.  329 people and I can see each other’s life, or what we choose to post about it.   I can say that I know 329 people, and then some, because not every single person I know is on Facebook.  But what kind of relationship do I have with these people? 

Relationship is defined as an emotional or other connection between people.  I am connected to each of these 329 people in some way; that is how we ended up Facebook friends.  But the type of relationship varies greatly, and it can probably be summed up in one word...communication.  My communication with my friends list varies from...the friend who never logs in, the friend who logs in but doesn’t see my posts, the friend who scrolls past my posts but doesn’t comment, the friend who comments or likes my posts...to the friend who has ongoing communication with me. That is the friend with whom I have the closest relationship. 

Is Jesus on your friends list, and how do you know him?  He is always logged in to your life, he sees all, knows all, acknowledges all...he wants to communicate with you.  Are you logged in, do you hear his word, do you know him and acknowledge him as Lord?  That is a true relationship, and that is the narrow gate through which Jesus wants us to enter. 

> _Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it._  -[Matthew 7:13-14][1]
