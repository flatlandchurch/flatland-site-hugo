It has been said that for some we are the only Bible they will ever read. The world is watching us when we call ourselves Christian. But they can't "read" the Bible, if we have not applied it to our hearts and minds. We need to apply God’s Word to our lives so that others might see Christ and come to Him who saves. [As Peter says][1], we share in God’s divine nature when we believe so that participation should drive us to represent the Word well.

[Peter says][2] God’s Word is a “light shining in a dark place” so we “do well to pay attention to it”. As we apply God’s Word to our lives, we become a light shining in a dark place. We need to continually apply Scripture to everything we do and say so that the light of Christ will shine brighter and brighter. When we just internalize Scripture without allowing it to actuate within us, we are like that light Jesus mentions in his [sermon on the mount][matt5], hidden under a bowl. The answer to the question "why?" is "Him, them, Christ shining out from us."

### Reflections
- Thinking back on this series, we have learned a lot. What has it been that struck you the most important?

> _For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” a made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ._ -[2 Corinthians 4:5-6][2cor4]
