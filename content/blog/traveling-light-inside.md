### [Luke 11:37-54][1]

_While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table.  The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner._  Luke 11:37-38
 
Now we may look at this as an unclean act, that anyone would not wash their hands before dinner.  But the washing referred to in this verse was a ritual washing, often with unclean water.  It was a man-made tradition, one which the Pharisees took upon themselves to make holy.  
 
But Jesus refused to follow this ritual.  He was more interested in what was on the inside, which in the case of the Pharisees was greed and wickedness.  
 
There are still those who follow man-made rituals.  Some enter the church and dip their fingers in holy water.   Some will not enter church in anything but their “Sunday best”.  Elaborate rituals exist for baptizing babies, for first communion and confirmation. They stand around and cast aspersions upon those in the church who don't measure up to their standards, just like the Pharisees did. 
 
But Jesus [stands at our door][2] and asks, what’s inside?  What’s underneath the Sunday best, what’s inside the heart of the child taking his first communion, what’s behind the blessing made with holy water?  He stands there, looking inside, beyond the rituals he did not create.  Will we tear down the external and let him in to cleanse us on the inside?
 
### Questions:
1. If you grew up in a church with rituals, has it been hard to give them up?  Is it okay to continue taking part in rituals, as long as your heart is in it?
2. What makes something sacred?  Can you create a sacred space in your home, without an ordained minister performing a ritual?
