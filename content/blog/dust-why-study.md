#### [Matthew 7:24-27][1]

Why should we read and study the Bible? I was almost frozen with what to write because I had a ton of answers: because it is God telling us who He is, because it is just fun to read, because wiser people than me say we should, because when we donâ€™t know who God is, we make up a god in our own image that leads to ruin, because ....

Jesus said we have a choice on where to build our lives; on Him, the rock or on anything else, the sand. As we read and study the Bible we are reading all about Jesus. We allow it to move and change us as we allow the Holy Spirit to reach out of the words and into our hearts. As we read we respond in prayer to Him which leads us to respond by telling others about what we read.

We build our lives on the Rock, a solid foundation that will help us through every storm life throws at us. When we love someone, we want to get to know everything we can about them. Reading/studying the Bible is our way to get to know Jesus. It will solidify our relationship with Him. It will build our house on the Rock. Dust it off! Get to know Him who saves. Wear it off! Build your life on the solid rock.

### Reflection
* Upon what are you building your life?
* How can you grow in your relationship with God?
