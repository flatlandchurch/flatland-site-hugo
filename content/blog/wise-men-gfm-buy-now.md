How many items have you ordered from Amazon this year?  Be honest, open your account and look at your order history.  Now take inventory of those items.  Which ones did you need, which did you want, and which brought glory to God?

The trip to Walmart has turned into a “Buy now” button we push from the comfort of our home.  Instead of unloading the trunk we’re unloading from our front porch.  It’s gotten so easy to shop that if we’re not careful we can fall down the rabbit hole and worse, into a hoarding trap.

_But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth_ ([Deuteronomy 8:18][1]).  I needed the vacuum bags I ordered on Amazon, but what is the purpose of the necklace I ordered?  While I am fortunate that I’m able to make these purchases, my neighbor may be scraping pennies to put gas in her car to get her children to school this week.  Is the vase I ordered bringing glory to God, or could that $18.99 be put to better use?

These are the questions to put on our hearts during this season, and all seasons.  How much are you worth?  And how much is God’s kingdom worth?

> _And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus_ ([Philippians 4:19][2]).
