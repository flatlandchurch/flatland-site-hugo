[Psalm 84][psa84] exclaims "What joy for those..." (NLT) or "blessed are those" (NIV, ESV) several times. The psalmist can declare this with certainty because it is based on his assurance that the Lord Almighty (or Lord of hosts) will guarantee it. This title for God appears hundreds of times in the Old Testament, especially in the prophets. Isaiah says it over 60 times. It is a title that usually accompanies a declaration that something will happen because the Lord Almighty will do it.

We can wander around life empty, wishing for something better but it is always just out of reach. We can strive hard, chase after those dreams, but in the end, it is all empty, joyless. But when we believe in Christ and follow Him, we will find joy where we didn't expect it. We will find fulfillment and satisfaction. As we draw closer to God life will become great, not because of anything we do but because of the Lord God Almighty.

> _What joy for those who can live in your house,_   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_always singing your praises._   
> _What joy for those whose strength comes from the LORD_   
> _O LORD of Heavenâ€™s Armies,_   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_**what joy for those who trust in you.**_ -Psalm 84:4, 5, 12 (NLT)
