[James 3:1-6][1]

Your “check engine” light is one of the tiniest parts of your car. But it is a huge indication that, left unheeded, the entire car is headed for danger, stranded on the side of some dark road, taking all passengers with it. James points out that our tongue, while one of the smaller members of our body, is a huge indicator telling us where our entire being is headed. He likens it to the condition of the rudder, a relatively small member, which directs the entire ship. Left unchecked – by even one degree – the rudder takes the ship ever further from its desired destination. Fortunately, the savvy of an experienced captain monitors and employs the rudder wisely to safely stay the course.

Leaving our tongue in the trust of unsavvy worldly influence, including our own, results in us getting further and further from the center of God’s kingdom. We just don’t have the savvy it takes to control our tongue, speaking in love at all times. And our crude, sarcastic, impatient or even angry tone not only sets _us_ off course, but our listeners are shanghaied as well. Just think of what you learned from a teacher who was unkind, angry or in any way unsavvy. You most likely learned that you just want to get away from such people, while harboring disdain for anything, possibly including truth, they may have spoken. Since James points out that [mere mortals are incapable of taming the tongue,][2] which is set on fire [by hell itself,][3] what hope do we have of saving ourselves, let alone making disciples for Christ?

Thankfully, when Jesus comes into our lives, [He fills us with the savvy of the Holy Spirit.][4] Today is the day to use _**His**_ savvy to decide who’s fire you’ll allow to set your tongue ablaze. Will it be the fire of hell, which like an unbridled horse, will run amuck taking you, its rider with it? Or [will your tongue be afire with the Holy Spirit,][5] bringing your whole being under the direction of the Lord and evidenced by your supernatural ability to speak the truth in authentic love?

> _But if you refuse to serve the Lord, then choose today whom you will serve. Would you prefer the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates? Or will it be the gods of the Amorites in whose land you now live? But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord._ Joshua 24:15 NLT
