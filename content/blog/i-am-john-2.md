[**Today’s Reading: John 2**][j2]

Jesus was constantly confronted by the leaders of the Jews to demonstrate his [authority by a sign][j218]. One of the first times comes right after Jesus gets bent out of shape over merchants selling sheep and cattle in the Temple courts. They were taking advantage of people who wanted to do a sacrifice but didn’t have an animal to do so. But what was so wrong about this, they were filling a need by these people? They were turning the Father’s house into something that was opposite of what God wanted.

When God instructed Moses on the original tabernacle, He set it up with the intent to pull people into worship of Him. It started in the temple courts and led to the altar and eventually the Holy of Holies. God prescribed the look, the smells, the sounds, the feel and even the tastes that went on in His house. It was all amazing, beautiful, and moving. There were musicians proclaiming the glory of God continually throughout the day while the sacrifices were being made. The temple represented God among man... Jesus was God among man.

In a clash the merchants were bringing cacophony into the temple. The sounds of animals, the smell of animals, the shouting of merchants, “Get your lamb here!” How were people suppose to focus on God, bring glory to Him in all that mess? Jesus saw all this and was furious. His Father was being ignored in favor of a lot of money making. So he reacts and is questioned. How dare he? Who does he think he is? What does he have to prove that he can do that?

‘Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”’ ([John 2:19 NIV][j219]) He was referring to his death and resurrection and not that big thing in Jerusalem. The sign of his authority is the resurrection. The sign that he is the Son of God is Easter. Without it, there is no Christianity. The resurrection changes everything, including you and me.

> _For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures_

> _If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep._

> _Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed._ -[1 Corinthians 15:3-4,13,17,20,51-52][1c15]
