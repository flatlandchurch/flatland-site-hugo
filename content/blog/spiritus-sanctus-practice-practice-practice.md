[**Proverbs 12:1**][1]

Walking in step with the Holy Spirit requires discipline. While this may seem like the most obvious of statements, it’s still worth the reminder. Consider, for example, playing an instrument in the New York Philharmonic. A lifetime of discipline would be required even for consideration for membership in this elite orchestra. And, consideration for professional sports teams is similar, in that membership usually follows a lifetime of dedicated discipline to the sport. Christianity, on the other hand, requires no prior experience. We simply accept the fact that [we’re not perfect][2], and [Jesus has paid the penalty for all of our sins with His life.][3] And, that on the third day thereafter, He rose from the grave, destroying the power of death over us. In gratitude to Him, we accept Him as our Lord and [proclaim His Lordship over us to others.][4]

While no matter what life discipline we live out, once we’re members, the practice continues from day one. For example, Wayne Gretzky, “The Great One” as he was called in the NHL, followed and practiced his coaches’ disciplines every single day without fail. He said; “If I ever get to the point that I feel I don’t need a coach, I’ve gotten too full of myself to be any good”. And, a great concert pianist once wrote; “If I go one day without practice, I can tell the difference. If I go two days, my peers can tell the difference. If I go three days without practice, the world can tell the difference”.

Using these truths about consistent daily discipline illustrates how effective we can be as team members for our Lord [in the life position to which we’re assigned.][5] Note that Jesus freely provides everything we need for victory by giving us the Holy Spirit. The Spirit not only fully equips us, but [empowers us supernaturally][6] so we can accomplish what we could never do alone. Walking in step with Him requires becoming more and more full of His abundantly available resources by way of [practice][7] in His Spiritual disciplines. How consistently you practice fasting, sacrifice, celebration, meditation, solitude, lifestyle, confession, tithing, prayer, study, rest, and attendance gives you the best view of how you’re walk with the Holy Spirit is progressing, and shows you and the world how effective you are as a team member.

> _Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever **practices** and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven._ Matthew 5:19 NIV
