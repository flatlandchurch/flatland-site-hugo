This week our challenge is to pray for the leaders of our church. Yes. But shouldn’t we be praying for our leaders all the time? We have a responsibility to lift up in prayer our leaders; the pastors, evangelists, missionaries, teachers, prophets, elders, and deacons&mdash;which means servant&mdash;all those who are called to serve in the church.[¹][1] [²][2] Ok, but how?

Our leaders are people first and foremost and need prayers for all the same things we do; health, family, cars breaking down, or house payments that are sometimes scary. We need to pray that God will meet their daily needs.[³][3]

Our leaders also face other pressures that although we have they have even more. They are representatives of Christ before the world. Their lives above all are scrutinized by the world. We need to pray that they have strength to resist the devil[⁴][4] in all ways that God’s light may shine brightly from them.[⁵][7]

We need to pray for those who preach and teach the Word. James says that those who teach will be held to a high standard.[⁶][8] They need prayer for strength and determination as they study, learn, and prepare. We need to pray that God will anoint their words with the power of the Holy Spirit. We need to pray that as they speak, God will pour out His Spirit on those listening, to strengthen believers and to convict unbelievers to repentance.

We also need to pray for those who serve in less visible areas. They need strength and encouragement. They are important! The Body is only effective when all are motivated and moving in the same direction. There are many parts and they need to be a well oiled machine. 

We need to pray for the unity of our leaders, that they may do as they are called,
> _“to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.”_ -[Ephesians 4:12-13][9]
