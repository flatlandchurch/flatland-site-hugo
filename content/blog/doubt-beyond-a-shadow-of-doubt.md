**[Colossians 1:15-2:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians1:15-2:3)**

We have saving faith in truth.  The truth is that God is the Creator and, therefore sovereign, having supreme power and authority over all He created.  Unfortunately, the world has many opinions which it mistakenly assumes as truth.  Popular among the world's people is the "big bang theory".  But, those who claim to believe in this theory as truth are neither able to provide, nor willing to discuss answers essential to making a true commitment to their faith.  For example; how did the very first element come into existence (from what was it composed)? And, as we know there is no gravity or wind in space, once "composed", what force caused it to move to the "big bang location"?  And, since there is no friction in space, what caused it to stop when it got there?  Then, how did all the other elements essential to cause a "bang" follow this pattern of self-creation, self-motivation and self-direction in order to arrive and remain at this same exact location?  Scientific logic itself demands the very response it is woefully unable to provide.

We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that nothing comes from nothing.  Taking this vey elementary fact to the next logical truth yields absolute assurance that there has to be someone who existed before creation – before the first "thing" came into being.  Of course, we know that God exists. Creation itself testifies to this truth.  And, of course the Creator is sovereign over all of His creations, and any human inventor can understand that this is so.  And, as if that weren't enough, God came to earth to reveal Himself personally (v15).  Think of it, He came to us while we were still lost in our own sins (v21) so that through His sacrifice – and none of our own – we are saved.  And, we know that He is our head (v18).  Therefore, we can now rejoice and thank God that we are no longer like chickens without headship drifting around aimlessly to our death.

We also know that God, who really is a wise person,  speaks to us and is actively imparting real and valuable wisdom to us, as any wise and good teacher does (v29).  Perhaps, most significant in these verses is that tiny word "if" in verse 23.  Here we have both the strongest assurance and the strongest warning in one word.  To that end, we know that we are saved only by faith in Jesus Christ.  Our salvation is real and irrevocable to all when we simply keep our Head (Christ) and do not waiver or drift from this assurance by entertaining doubt in the Truth ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John14:6), [18:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John18:37)).  As long as we allow our Head, and no "substitute" (other body part) to do our thinking and planning in our day to day activities, we have the faith that saves (vv 22-23).

**Questions**

1. What challenges to your faith cause you to entertain doubt?  How do you respond to these challenges?
2. Read [Acts 4:8-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts4:8-12).  What role does the Holy Spirit play in completely destroying doubt?
