#### [Genesis 2:18][1]
 
In the beginning, God created everything and everything He created was good. Over and over, He declared it to be so [(Genesis 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31).][2] Note, however, that when He sees man standing amongst a world of only good, God says something for the first time: “It is not good”. Even in a world completely devoid of anything bad, God knew something Adam didn’t. God knew he was not going to make it alone. So, God immediately provides a solution to this “not good”. He creates fellowship (see Gen. 2:18).

The condition of our fallen world today is so much different from the good condition, as it was created. Since God knew we needed fellowship then, how much more do you think He sees that we need it now? Nevertheless, we sometimes tend to withdraw from – instead of lean into – the help He created and abundantly provides for us. Withdrawing from fellowship; the exact help that God Himself knows we need, is self-harm. Still, just knowing this doesn’t solve the problem. So, what are we supposed to do?

First of all, [consider the needs of others above your own.][3] Ask yourself: “What should I do as a follower of Christ about the hurting people He surrounds me with”? One thing I need to know is that I am responsible when I engage and I am responsible when I neglect to engage. So, engage. Engage the people you know, of course, but don’t neglect those around you whom you have never, or don’t usually speak to. Introduce yourself. And don’t just ask “how are you?”, because in today’s hurting society, that usually gets us no further than a one-word response; “fine”. Some ways you can get around this include rephrasing the question. “How are you _really_ doing right now?”, “How can I pray for you today?”, “What’s going on in your life that most people don’t know?” Eye contact here is vital. Your authentic sincerity will be recognized in your eyes and may encourage a response not previously expected by either of you.

Remember, Adam didn’t ask for help. He had never needed help, so how could it occur to him to even ask? Like Adam, most of us don’t recognize our need for help until our lives are too messy to feel comfortable inviting someone else in. Being alone is “_not good_”. The solution God provides **is** “_good_”. And when God Himself says that, in every circumstance, we need fellowship, it’s definitely not good to argue with Him. Let’s move in agreement with God’s plan, desire, and abundant provision for us to have joy for ourselves as we share His joy others.

### Challenges
- If you’re just having a tough day, it usually doesn’t take much to share your feelings with others. But how much courage would it take for you to open up to someone when, what seemed at first to be sadness, has evolved over time into depression?
- Get into a [Life Group,][4] a community of believers who love unconditionally. Share with others, knowing that what’s said is kept sacred and confidential. Dive into the solution God has put right in front of you.
