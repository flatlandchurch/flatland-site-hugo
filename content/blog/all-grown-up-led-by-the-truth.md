The Book of Acts tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman Empire.  In chapter 17 Paul and his companions preached the gospel in Thessalonica, resulting in a group of followers as well as a group of non-believers who started a riot. 

> _The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue. Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the Word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so._  -[Acts 17:10-11][acts17]

The Bereans who protected Paul, unlike the others in Thessalonica, received the Word with fervency.  They protected their leaders, but they also went back home and examined the Scriptures to see if what these leaders preached lined up the Word of God.  

To question our spiritual leaders is not insubordination, it is nobility.  To be insubordinate means to defy authority.  To be noble means to have or show fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.  Jesus is the only true authority in our lives, and he appointed his first spiritual leaders. 

> _Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you._  -[Mathew 28:16–20][mat28]

The Bereans turned to the Word to verify what Paul and his companions said.  While our Lord continues to call on spiritual leaders to spread the gospel, those leaders are sinners just like us. And while we are called to follow the Holy Spirit, we need leaders to help us in that calling. The noble man will affirm that his leaders are being led by the truth that can only be found in the Word. 

> _All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work._ -[2 Timothy 3:16-17][2tim3]
