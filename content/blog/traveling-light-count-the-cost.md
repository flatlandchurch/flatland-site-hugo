### [Luke 14:25-33][1]

When I read Jesus’ warning to count the cost of being his disciple I often wonder why Jesus would try to chase away people. It sounds as if he only wants fanatics as disciples. And it is true! Only fanatics go to a football game on freezing weather dressed in only body paint. Only fanatics can walk the walk Jesus has called us to. 

Like in the [parable of the sower and the seeds][2], many become followers of Christ only to fall away or be so overwhelmed by the cares of this world that they do not flourish. The cost of being a disciple is high and without commitment we will fail. Jesus wants us to be fully devoted to Him. 

The writer to the Hebrews has a warning that should send shivers through us about committing to Christ only to reject him later, [Hebrews 6:1-8][3]. The cost is higher if we reject the Good News! It may seem as if there is no cost to *not* following Christ but in the end, the cost is everything and for all eternity. When we follow Christ, it may cost us a lot now but when we finish the [race][4] we get eternal life, [Romans 6:23][5].  When we hear Jesus warning about the cost we have to compare it to the cost of not being his devoted disciple. The cost of being a disciple may be high but we win when we follow him. 

> _I say to the LORD, ‘You are my Lord;_ 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_apart from you I have no good thing.’_
> _LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup;_ 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_you make my lot secure._
> _I keep my eyes always on the LORD._
> &nbsp;&nbsp;_With him at my right hand, I shall not be shaken_. -[Psalm‬ ‭16][6]

### Action
Compare what have you not been willing to give up for Christ to the rewards available for paying the cost. Ask the Father to help you become more committed to His kingdom.
