None of us are Superman.  Raise your hand if you’ve broken a bone, had a joint replaced, had a major organ removed, suffered cancer...you have the scars to prove it.  Raise the other hand if you’ve been through an emotional trauma...the loss of a loved one, a broken relationship, bullying...you have the scars to prove it.  Paul experienced suffering which physically and emotionally hurt and discouraged him and left scars.  Yet he wrote to the Corinthians:

> _That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day.  For our present troubles are small and won’t last very long. Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever!_  -[2 Corinthians 4:16-17][2co416]

Paul insists that he is not going to give up. He refuses to give in to the temptation to live in despair. Outwardly he is physically wasting away because of his suffering for preaching about Jesus. But inwardly he is strong and determined and more convinced than ever of his purpose to carry the light of the gospel to the world.

God uses fragile vessels to carry his powerful truth. If we refuse to despair at our troubles, whether physical or emotional, but turn our face toward Jesus, Superman will prevail.

> _So we don’t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever._ -[2 Corinthians 4:18][2co418]
