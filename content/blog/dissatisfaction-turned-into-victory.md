**[Colossians 3:17-4:6]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians3:17-4:6)**

God wants us to live victorious lives. Instead we all too often live dissatisfied lives. We get so focused on what is going wrong around us that we see only that. We measure our current lives against the could have beens and despair. But God wants us to focus on Him, living every moment for Him, rejoicing over what He has provided to us and the opportunities He is giving us now.

Paul talking to slaves tells them to work for their masters as if they were God. Not an easy thing. Some work for bosses that make them feel like slaves. Even so, we must work with the same enthusiasm as we would for the very best boss. We can't allow dissatisfaction to beat us down and tear us apart. The only way is to live our lives for God.

Jobs, finances, people, they all can make us dissatisfied. But when we see them all as opportunities to serve God, when we live with full bore enthusiasm for God we will be victorious over all of them.

**Questions - Ask Yourself This**
1. What opportunity do I have today to serve God?
2. What dissatisfying situation can God turn into a victory if I but serve Him?
