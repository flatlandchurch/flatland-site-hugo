[**2 Timothy 4:9-22**][1]

Life of Tim: Ready - Gofer

Although imprisoned for speaking the truth, Paul remains ready to serve. Here, on a cold stone floor, he preaches the Gospel in his chains and write letters for the benefit of our salvation. He’s in much need of a helper. Now Timothy, with church responsibilities of his own, is being approached by Paul with a list of needs. Come ASAP. Bring Mark. Be sure to bring my coat. Bring my books and don’t forget my papers. Deliver greetings. Make haste to get here before winter. Is Tim ready?

Young, by the standards of his time, with the grace of God Timothy has advanced in church leadership, surpassing worldly expectations. He’s responsible for the lives of many and doesn’t fold under pressure. And, as a church leader, he must have people working under his anointed leadership who are involved in completing the extremely necessary but less complex issues. He must have gofers working with him for any church to thrive. Nevertheless, being a gofer, going hundreds of miles out of his way to fetch a coat for a cold man, is not a task that’s beneath his dignity. He’s always ready to serve in any capacity that would bring light to the Gospel.

How about you? Have you advanced in your vocation? Do you ever get the prideful feeling that some of the tasks you performed in your earliest days are now beneath your dignity?  As Christians, this must never be the case with us. If we’re going to reveal Jesus to anybody, they must see Jesus in our example. Suffering for our sins was absolutely a job beneath God’s dignity. Yet, Jesus worked for us in abject humility to give us the perfect example for living as as a saint. So now, when someone asks you to do something and you don’t believe it’s important enough for you, it’s most likely because you aren’t ready to serve in that area. If today is fully booked with “self-importance” you won’t believe you have time to humbly serve others as God gives you opportunities.

What will you do now to prepare yourself today - and every day - to live as God’s gofer?
