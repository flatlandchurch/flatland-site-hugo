[**Titus 2**][1]

The world and the Spirit are in a life and death battle. In the shortest of terms, if the world loves us, it’s a sign of our submission to it and our assimilation into it. If, on the other hand, we don’t fit in and the world hates us, it’s a sign that we’re upholding godly standards. Jesus said exactly this in [John 15:19][2], so if it comes as a surprise, it’s not because we weren’t told. It flies in the face of all human reason, but to be victorious and help others on to victory, we must surrender – to Jesus.

Let’s face it, to declare absolute truth in broad daylight is counter-cultural and it’s often viewed as rude, if not a direct attack, by those who want to remain in darkness. Knowing the truth, through daily devotion to study of the Word, is the first and absolutely essential step in making disciples. We must know what the Bible says and why it’s saying it or our testimony will tumble like a house of cards. Even so, knowing what to say and wen to say it (or not to say it) requires wisdom and discernment.

When you talk about truth with people, it’s always best to start with questions. Care about the person enough to listen to what interests them right where they are and find out what things they’re good at. Showing love to someone you’re talking with will teach you a lot about their learning style. For example, some learn best from one who gets directly to the point, while others learn best through stories and illustrations. Listening with sincere eagerness to learn about them earns us the right to be heard. Then, when you begin to profess the truth, remember your humble beginnings as a slave. For the grace of God offers salvation and freedom to all people and you are one of those people. Professing the truth in humility is exactly what Jesus did, so always speak the truth in the same love and patience you are showered with. To be disciple makers, we must surrender ourselves wholly in gratitude to Jesus. We must intentionally and genuinely love others to attract them to the source of love. It is absolutely a matter of eternal life or eternal death for them.

In this life and death battle, are you ready to surrender your entire life to helping Jesus move people to the center of His kingdom? If not, identify what needs to happen before you are ready.

> _If anyone wants to keep his own life safe, he must lose it. If anyone gives up his life because of Me, he will save it._ Luke 9:24 NLV
