[**Judges 1-2,**][1] [**17-18**][2]

There is few sadder passages in the Bible as “another generation grew up who knew neither the Lord nor what he had done for Israel. Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord.” ([Judges 2:10-11][3]) It is surprising how fast we fall back into Babylon, a worldly life absent of godliness, when we forget who the Lord God Almighty is. Judges is full of stories where temporarily the people would call on God rescue them and then follow Him, but only because they were afraid of suffering under other people living in the land--people they should have kicked out, according to the command of the Lord. That was the whole problem with the people of Israel, they didn’t follow God’s command to clean out the land from foreigners, people that could and did lead them away from Him. As such, as soon as things got comfortable again, they would slide back into following other gods, gods from those very people who would turn on them.

But there is one story in [Judges 17][4] that may be even sadder, the story of a young Levite, a man who should have know the way of the Lord but who was led astray. He was enticed by being the one in charge, have his own little church, with his own religious trappings and a captive audience. Despite clear commands of the Lord, Micah had created an idol from silver consecrated to the Lord and the young Levite was installed as a priest to this false god as well as to the Lord. He did the very thing that would bring displeasure from the Lord.

It is bad enough when we get led astray by people that are not Christians but when a brother or sister in Christ strays from God’s way and leads others into Babylon too, that is tragedy. It is not always easy to recognize false teachings and wrong ways. It is important to be constant in reading Scripture, learning from solid Christian teachers, and listening to the Holy Spirit for guidance.

The main lesson we also learn from Judges is to be teachers, leading and showing the next generation the truth of the Lord. The responsibility of adults is to teach the next generation, live the truth, and lead our children into having living relationships with the Lord. The next generation can not just hear about God, they must have a solid relationship with our Lord. When we do, we will have written about our children, “another generation grew up who knew the Lord and lived in His grace.”

> _In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned._ -Titus 2:7-8
