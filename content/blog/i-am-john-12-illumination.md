[**Today’s reading: John 12 – Illumination**][jhn12]

John packs a lot into this chapter of his Gospel. He lets us know he was present when Lazarus’ family held a dinner in Jesus’ honor. He notes Mary anointing Jesus and Jesus allowing it. Jesus knows what no one else knows at this time; this will be the only opportunity for His friend to anoint His body for burial (v7). John tells us the whole house is filled with the fragrance of the ointment.  Who else but an actual eye witness can give us such detail?

John gives an account of Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem, exactly as was prophesied. He tells us of some Greeks who want to meet Jesus. In response to this request, Jesus goes into one of His cryptic messages. In this case he talks about a seed which must die in order to produce many new seeds.

We now hear the Voice of God speaking from Heaven. Still, many don’t follow Him.

Perhaps the most important thing in this chapter we must understand is that Jesus is the Light. Even though we may not be thinking of it today, Jesus knows His time with us in this flesh is short. He urgently declares that we have a relatively short time to make a decision to walk in the Light. If we simply focus on walking with Jesus – walking in the Light – everything else will work out for God’s glory and our benefit. Jesus is illuminating the path and leading us to the place from which He came. On the other hand, those who continue to choose to walk in the darkness can’t see or even imagine where they’re headed.

Have you stumbled in your life? Do you think you were trusting in the Lord when you did?

John 12:46 New Living Translation (NLT)
> _I have come as a light to shine in this dark world, so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark._ -[John 12:46 (NLT)][jhn1246]
