[James 3:13-18][1]

We find in the New Testament a common theme; the dichotomy between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world. God’s wisdom is seen as total [foolishness to the world][2]. The world says you can’t win the game if you don’t make yourself number one and all else can be stepped on if needed.

James, on the other hand, wants us to live “an honorable life, doing good works with the humility that comes from God’s wisdom.” [Jesus took children in his arms][3] and proclaimed that we needed to humble ourselves like children to become the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. It seems like complete foolishness. Jesus was annoyed by the leaders of the Jews because they puffed themselves up to be all that. Jesus’ attitude in turn annoyed them, they believed themselves to be the wise ones, Jesus the fool.

Yet [Jesus set out Himself as an example for us][4]. Putting aside all rights of being God, He humbled Himself that we might be saved. In the same way, we put ourselves to the side and lift others up. In doing so, people will come to Christ, move closer to God, and we will see a great harvest of righteousness.

> _Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world._ -[Philippians 2:14-15][5]ESV
