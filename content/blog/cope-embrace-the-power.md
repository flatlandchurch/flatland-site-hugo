[**John 14:15-27**][jhn1415]

Jesus told his disciples that after he went to the Father, the Father would send another Paraclete ([John 14:16][1]). I prefer the translation of the Greek word Paraclete as “advocate” as opposed to “helper” (see [John 14:16][1], [26][2], [15:26][3], [16:7][4]). The word literally means, “called to ones side” and was used during Jesus’ day to refer to a legal representative. The Holy Spirit _is_ a helper but more so. The Holy Spirit stands with us as the Advocate when we are opposed and accused by the world. The Spirit is our champion and our power to cope with the world and it’s hatred of all things Christ including our faith in Him.

Jesus says that the Holy Spirit will teach us what to say when people come against us ([Luke 12:12][5], [John 14:26][2]). He will speak through us, advocating for us, proving us innocent. Not only innocent before people but we find no condemnation with God because the Spirit has set us free through Jesus Christ. This freedom Paul says brings life eternally even to our mortal bodies ([Romans 8:1-11][6]). The Advocate wins the case and rescues us, starting when we believe going into eternity.

You may have noticed that Jesus said “another Paraclete.” Jesus is of course the first Paraclete. John writes “we have a Paraclete with the Father--Jesus Christ--the Righteous One.” ([1 John 2:1][7]) Jesus advocates for us before the Father to get us declared innocent of sin, not because of what we did but because “He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.” ([1 John 2:2][7]) The advocate, Jesus, wins the case and rescues us. The power that saves us also lives in us through the Holy Spirit to lead others to Jesus. We are on the winning side.

We all too often disregard the very power to live abundantly and joyfully which God has provided us through the Holy Spirit, the power to overcome anything that comes against us. We often fail to cope with life and all that is thrown at us because we try to do it all on our own. We have disregarded the gift God provides. The Holy Spirit is given to empower us to live for Christ and to proclaim the Good News of salvation. Let us seek, wait, and expect the Holy Spirit to be poured out on us and work in our lives. With faith in Jesus we have the power of the Holy Spirit so let us seek it, grab a hold of it, live boldly for Christ, and see great things happen in the name of Jesus.

> I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father. -[John 14:12][8]
