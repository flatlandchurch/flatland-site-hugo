[**Titus 1:1-4**][ti1]

Pastor Bart got me distracted almost immediately during the message Sunday. I know he said something different but what my puny brain put together was, “How many times has God called me to do something I had no clue how to do?” That led to the question, “How many times have I disregarded God’s call because I thought, ‘I can’t do that!’” Fortunately, that distraction was first service so I could listen more attentively during the second service and take notes. Even still, I couldn’t get away from the feeling I had let God down. Then I heard God say something else, “Move to the center! Lead others to the center. Don’t look back, look to the Center, God. Just Move.”

The research team has always had one of those interesting effects on people. It isn’t an easy ministry at Flatland. I think we have scared a lot of people away from this ministry because it looks hard, primarily because of the writing (there are other ways to participate in research team). But I know there are multiple people at Flatland that God is calling to join this ministry. Yes, you may not have a clue how to study God’s Word. Yes, you may not have a clue how to write devotionals. Yes, you may think you don’t have the time. But that doesn’t matter if God is calling you to do it. God will equip and we on the team will help. Ok, enough selfish call for volunteers to the research team.

We heard Sunday Flatland has a big need for volunteers in the nursery and children’s ministries. Yes, you may have no clue how to do it but if God has put that ministry on your heart, He will empower you to be able to do it with other volunteers there to help teach you. Flatland always has needs in many different ministries. If God calls, move and then be faithful and confident in your call. There is one “ministry” into which He doesn’t call us, to sit on our hands and be bumps on a log. Hear God’s call, answer with the affirmative, and move. God is calling us all. _**Move to the center! Lead others to the center. Don’t look back, look to the Center, God. Let’s Move!!**_

> _May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace._ -Titus 1:4
