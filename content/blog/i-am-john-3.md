[**Today's Reading: John 3 - Born Again**][jhn3]

In John chapter 3 we see a pharisee named Nicodemus visiting Jesus and puzzling over the concept of being born again. Jesus explains that “no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.” (vss 5-6) Being born again is a spiritual birth, one that can only come by God.
 
The birth of a baby is a joyous occasion.  Parents, family, and close friends celebrate the new and precious life.  Visits, gifts, showers ensue.  The baby is born to his parents, a birth in the flesh, worthy of celebration.  A new life has begun. 
 
More worthy of celebration is rebirth in the Spirit.  Life begins anew when we understand the sin into which we are born.  As a response to this awareness, we ask forgiveness for sin, repent, and ask Jesus to be Lord of our lives.  This is the moment God’s Spirit penetrates our hearts to guide us and help us be more like Him. We are born in the Spirit...a joyous occasion, worthy of every celebration that occurred at our birth in the flesh, and infinitely more.
