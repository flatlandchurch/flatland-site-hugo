[**2 Timothy 2:15-26**][1]

“The Lord knows those who are His and every one who confesses the name of the Lord **must** turn away from wickedness.” (v19) The problem is that [the prince of this world][2] is bent on distracting us. Therefore, to stay focused, we need only remember who we are. We are saints; we’re literally daughters and sons of the King of Kings.

It doesn’t take much imagination to consider the difference between owners of a business and employees. In a family-owned restaurant, for example, the family shows up early each day focused on every aspect of welcoming guests and ensuring their experience is safe and enjoyable.  The family is constantly alert to everything that could harm the business from a bit of food that isn’t perfectly fresh to a spot of dirt in the restaurant to a single word spoken impolitely. On the other hand, the [hired hand][3] may show up at the last possible moment, or even find an excuse for running late and will be more prone to ignore difficult aspects of the business, or speak an unloving word. Note that at the end of the day, it’s the family - those who are his - that the owner takes home.

In verse 17, we’re introduced to Hymenaus and Philetus who misrepresent the King of Kings and thereby spread harm to the “business” of keeping the Gospel pure. We’re told that it’s such as these who will become regressive, “more ungodly”, because of the ungodly chatter in which they allow themselves to engage. As saints, we must be focused at all times. We must be operating with eyes wide open, not just noticing all areas of potential harm, but taking immediate action to address and diligently provide correction to such harmful threats. We must politely care for the people we serve, keeping the Gospel pure by sincerely loving everyone currently captive in Satan’s lies.

When you observe a misrepresentation of the Gospel message, is your response a family response or that of a hired hand?

> _Our fight is not with people. It is against the leaders and the powers and the spirits of darkness in this world. It is against the demon world that works in the heavens._  Ephesians 6:12 New Life Version
