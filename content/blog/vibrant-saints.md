[Philippians 4:6-23][1]
 
Saints are commonly known as holy men and women who have lived exemplary Christian lives and, after their deaths, are now in the presence of God in Heaven.  Some religions pray to patron saints, those who, having already transcended to the metaphysical, are able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges.  Saint Anthony was a priest, who upon his death was canonized the saint of lost things, having lost and then recovered an important psalter book.  Those who believe in patron saints pray to Saint Anthony when they have lost something.

The New Testament, however, portrays every true believer as a saint, a word meaning simply holy one, or God’s chosen.  In fact, the word saint is mentioned 67 times, and never in reference to a special group of believers who serve God better than others. In the onset of his letter to the Philippians, Paul is clear that all Christians are saints:  "To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi…"  [Philippians 1:1][2]

If you’ve ever been called a saint, it was likely in the figurative sense (Thank you for helping me; you’re a saint!  You’re a saint for putting up with…).  It’s time we take up a literal sense to this word.  Volunteering at a homeless shelter doesn’t make you a saint, any more than writing a book makes you the patron saint of writing.  We are saints because we are followers of Christ, and that is a title we should wear proudly.

> _Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.  All the saints greet you._  Philippians 4:22

### Questions:

1. Are there people in your life you have called saints, because of their service or generosity or kindness?  Are they followers of Christ?
2. Do you accept the title of Saint, without any requirement other than to live the life God has chosen you for?
