### [Philippians 1][1]

Getting or even feeling offended can suck the joy right out of our lives. Disagreements are a normal part of life and can’t be avoided.  But remaining joyful at all times is possible ([James 1:2][2]) and includes deliberate choice on our part.

Getting bent out of shape in the workplace is common when employees disagree on procedures.  In construction, for example, disagreements can arise on which part of the labor needs to be completed next. Arguments can arise and tempers can flare.  Pride and joy simply cannot co-exist. The solution is found in allowing the boss to make the decision. After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for knowing the order of construction. The boss is educated and experienced. He knows best.

Many problems we face are complicated by the fact that we want to make things all about us and not about the job so we take conflict personally.  Therefore, whom we make things all about is critical.  When faced with disagreeable/offensive situations, be they political, religious, employment or even extremely intimate such as family, we should consult God.  By letting our Master make the calls, we relieve ourselves of the tough decision-making process and open ourselves up to his wisdom and teaching.  We have been given the right to ask God for help and we have been given the right to expect Him to deliver the full measure of help we need ([James 1:5][3]).

### Questions
1. Consider the last time you felt offended.  Do you think you could have avoided that feeling if you had realized that things aren’t all about you?
2. Read James 1:2-8. What stands out as something God is teaching you right now?
