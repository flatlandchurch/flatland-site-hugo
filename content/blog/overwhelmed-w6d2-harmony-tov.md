#### [Colossians 3:12-17][1]

A recent [Think Biblically podcast][2] was an interview with Scot McKnight who wrote with his daughter the book, _[A Church Called Tov][3]_. It caught my ear solely because of the word tov. What is tov? I learned quickly that it is the Hebrew word for good/goodness. So by asking, “What is tov?” we are also asking, “What is good?” One of the things I took from listening to the podcast is that [God is often called tov][4] and His people are [called to tov][5] as well.

What does tov look like? Paul is pretty clear that the Body of Christ needs to live in harmony with each other. Paul tells us a lot of different virtues that we should have but he condenses it all down to one thing, love. He says love binds everything in perfect unity. When we love each other, the other virtues like kindness, gentleness and patience will flow into our relationships. We will live in peace and harmony with each other. We will be a people of tov.

### Challenge
- Do you have a relationship that is broken? Read Colossians 3:12-17, praying that the Holy Spirit will guide you in a way to repair that relationship. And if you are overwhelmed with this, consider [getting a coach to help][6].
