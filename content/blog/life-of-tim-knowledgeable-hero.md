[**2 Timothy 4:1-8**][1]

“You should keep a clear mind…” (v5). As originally written, the words “clear mind” (nepho) mean to be self-controlled, clear headed, sober. And, especially in New Testament usage, it means to be vigilant; unwilling to take risks. Upon review of these attributes, you can see the attitude of a soldier, knowledgable in the procedure for standing night watch in order to protect lives from  enemy surprise attack. None of of these attributes are optional.

Keeping a clear mind means being confidently and keenly aware that the fulfillment of the mission is worth suffering for. While the suffering may range from the loss of a night’s sleep, to being taken prisoner, to a battle in which the possibility of death is on the line, one must keep one’s composure. One must stand as a pillar, being fully confident in one’s knowledge of the importance of fulfilling that mission. Those who avoid conflict by failing to stand their ground, are remembered as cowards, while those who stand firm to the end are remembered as heroes.

Our mission to share the Gospel is absolutely a life and death issue. But, unlike mortal death, which is only an instant in time, eternal death is living forever in confinement from the presence of God. Therefore, it is critical that we understand, that when (not if) the world attacks, we must know what to do. We must have sound scriptural training in order to calmly and confidently stand as pillars. We must place the importance of the mission of saving others far above a desire to avoid any form of temporary inconvenience or suffering - up to and including the momentary experience of death. Of course we know that death is certain and temporary. But for the heroes, life with our Father in Heaven is eternal.

> _You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved._ Matthew 10:22 NIV
