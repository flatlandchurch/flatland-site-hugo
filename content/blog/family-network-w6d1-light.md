#### [1 Timothy 1:15-16][1]

Jesus’ apostle, Paul, wrote the bulk of the New Testament. Countless millions of saints owe our salvation to his dedication to loving and serving the Lord. But remember, that when Paul first heard of Jesus, he set out on a mission to exterminate Christians. [This essential member of our family once tried to eradicate us.][2] That’s something one would think is “unforgivable”. Today, perhaps ironically, we realize that it was only through Christ’s immense love, patience and mercy toward Paul that so many of us are saved. We must be eternally grateful that Jesus saw through the dysfunction and into the light.

Do you see your home family as dysfunctional? The term “dysfunction” is relatively new, as it was coined by American sociologist Robert Merton in the mid 20th century. Although considered “the founding father of modern sociology”, Merton’s “discovery” is as old as time. When considering family network dynamics, I think the better question we should be asking is: “Is our family human?”. Because, every single one of us has been dysfunctional since sin entered the world. And the Bible has never glossed over this fact.

So, what hope do we humans have? Is there any way for us to have a peaceful loving relationship with one another in the midst of dysfunction? There sure is. And as simple as the answer may seem, it is, and always has been, Jesus - [the Light of the World.][5] Remember, that even before God created humans, He knew we would need a Savior. So, He lovingly made His perfect provision in advance. [Today, as always, Jesus tells us that we are the light of the world.][3] The light of the tiniest candle destroys darkness in a room, whereas all the darkness in the universe cannot destroy light. Jesus is calling you to be the light in your house. It’s a huge responsibility, but He never asks us to do something that’s impossible. As Christ did for Paul and for us, it’s now our turn to be the one to shine the light of Jesus’ immense love, patience and mercy onto those who don’t abide in His love. Even before sin entered your house, God lovingly made you, to be His provision.

### Challenges
- How does seeing yourself as God’s provision of light to a dark world make you feel?
- What do you think would be the result of gathering with other “light bearers”?
- Gather with others in a [Life Group][4] today.
