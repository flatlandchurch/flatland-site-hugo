#### [Psalm 51][p51]

It was said in Sunday’s message, “Jesus bore the weight of sin of the world, past, present and future.” We can get overwhelmed with our own “dirtiness,” the sin that we bear. The weird part, we all too often just give up and give in to sin. We think that “I am so bad, I have gone too far, God will not accept me. I might as well just keep on sinning.” We are overwhelmed with sin and flee from God.

Let me say it again, “Jesus bore the weight of sin of the world, past present and future.” Not “Jesus bore the weight of sin for some people”, not “God so loved a few people that he gave....” Forgiveness is for all who believe in Him, because Jesus has already taken the penalty for sin upon himself, before we ever were born, planned out before time began. Instead of fleeing from God when we sin, we need to bow before Him, ask forgiveness, and find victory in Him.

David when confronted with his sin, could have reacted in a lot of different ways, most, fleeing from God. But instead, he quickly repented. [Psalm 51][p51] is the musical form of that repentance. [Hebrews says][heb] “let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience." Fleeing only leads to more overwhelming defeat. Run towards God in faith knowing He forgives and takes away our guilty conscience.

### Challenge
- Is there a sin weighing you down? Turn to God with full confidence that He loves you, will forgive you, and transform you. Jesus has taken that weight already, accept it and become free.
