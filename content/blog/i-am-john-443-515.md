**Today's Reading: [John 4:43][jhn443] – [5:15][jhn515] - Signs and Wonders**

The Gospel of John focuses on the signs, or miracles, of the Messiah.  Jewish scripture is rich in describing the incredible signs which will be performed by Christ when He appears.  In our reading today, [a royal official asks][jhn443] for such a miracle on behalf of his dying son.  At this, Jesus announces that “Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders you will never believe.”  I don’t think this is necessarily a rebuke of the official, nor of his request, but rather Jesus stating a fact that God has known from the beginning.

Jesus gives this royal official his word of healing.  The man takes Him at His word, and heads home.  Of course, the son is healed at the instant of the spoken Word of God.  [Some time later][jhn515], Jesus heals an invalid who has suffered through some disability for 38 years.  Interesting that Jesus asks him “Do you want to get well?”.  While the man doesn’t give a direct response to the question, his desire to be healed is revealed in his repeated attempts.  Here again, we see that immediately by His spoken Word, Jesus heals. The man is instructed to pick up his mat and walk.  In faith, the man instantly obeys Jesus.

Rather than focusing on the obvious signs and wonders happening before their eyes just as God had promised, and rather than rejoicing over this man’s healing, the Jews focus on nit-picking over the fact that this is the Sabbath and “no work” shall be done on the Sabbath.  Here, and elsewhere, Jesus reveals Himself as Lord of the Sabbath, whether they recognize His authority or not.  Furthermore, Jesus tells this man to stop sinning, lest something far worse than physical ailment befall him.  In this, Jesus also reveals Himself as Lord of salvation, calling all of us, sick or otherwise, to repentance and into a life free from the shackles of sin.

Think of some signs and wonders happening in your life at this time.  Where is your focus?

> _It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.    
> How great are his signs,    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how mighty his wonders!    
> His kingdom is an eternal kingdom;    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his dominion endures from generation to generation._ -[Daniel 4:2-3 NIV][dan4]
