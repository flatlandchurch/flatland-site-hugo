[**John 16:16-33**][1]

After the fall, we have no indication that Father God allowed man to approach Him. Before Jesus came to earth, clothed in flesh for our protection, there was no direct access to the Father for people like you and me. Between these extremely significant events in our history, Jesus, who is “_The Angel of the Lord_” (as opposed to _an angel of the Lord_ elsewhere in scriptures) did not leave us or forsake us.  In fact, He spoke with us many times [Genesis 22:15, Exodus 3:2, Judges 2:1-4][2] et al.

Even so, there were strict guidelines on who could approach the “_Presence of God_”. Officials, such as priests and prophets, served as a “safety barrier” between us and the awesome power of God, similar to the way our atmosphere protects us from the awesome power of the sun.  When we, in our sin, sidestepped the protection provided us in God’s instructions, we were punished to the point of death.

The good news today is that Jesus’ sacrifice has dealt with our sin issue perfectly.  So much so, that all who love Him and embrace Him not just as our Savior, but Lord (boss) of our lives, [are grafted (romans 11:17) into His family as true children][3] with all rights and privileges granted every child by a truly loving Father.  Loving Jesus and accepting that God sent Him is the reason God not only loves us, but accepts us as His own kids.  We can now go running right up to our Daddy with every confidence He will pick us up, put us on His knee and listen to what we have to say.

> _In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God._ John 16:26-27 NIV
