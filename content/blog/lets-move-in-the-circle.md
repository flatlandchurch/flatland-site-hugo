[**Titus 3**][titus3]
We at Flatland often refer to “[Circle Theology][circle]” which is a simple way of saying those who believe in Christ are in the Kingdom of God. God is in the center of that Kingdom. The goal, as we have seen in this series, is to move to the center of the Kingdom, to move closer to God. It is important for us to understand that no matter where we are in the circle, we are all in need to move closer to God. It is only by the enabling of the Holy Spirit that we can even move. Simply put, we should not compare ourselves with others and think I am better or worse. We are all in the circle together. See what Paul said to [the Galatians][gal] and the [Colossians][col]. We say it this way at Flatland, “I love you.”

But we also say, “But I love you too much to leave you there” meaning, “Let’s move closer to God, to move to the center.” Admittedly that can come off as a haughty attitude and we have to constantly remind ourselves that moving to the center is for all of us, we are all in need. [James reminds us][james] that when we are helping others to move, we are held accountable. He then reminds us that we all stumble. In other words, our move to the center is not a straight line. It is more like a squiggly line, going to and fro, a tangle of a line but hopefully on average slowly moving to the center.

There are days when we can help others to move to the center and other days when we need someone to help us. On second thought, _every day_ we need to be moving to the center _together_ in the circle with our brothers and sisters in Christ. We need each other and the Holy Spirit. We will stumble occasionally, our move may become erratic, but God is there to help and He will send someone in the circle to help us. It is humbling to think that no matter how close we are to the center we may fall flat on our face. The second we think we are perfect and strut our stuff, that is the time when kablamo! So in humility **Let’s Move!** together in the circle.

> _Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom._ -James 3:13
