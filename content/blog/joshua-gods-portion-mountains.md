In **[Joshua 13-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua13-22)** the daunting task of allotting the land is recounted.  Caleb, the only spy besides Joshua who brought back a good report after spying out the land forty-five years prior, now claims his inheritance.  

Now 85, Caleb knew there were still obstacles to overcome and battles to be won, but he stayed faithful and was willing to possess the portion God had promised him.  And while others stood idle, unwilling to do the work to claim their inheritance, Caleb laid claim on not just a flat piece of uninhabited land, but a great fenced city on a mountain inhabited by giants.  

> _Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the LORD spoke in that day…
It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as the LORD said._  -Joshua 14:12

We all have a mountain standing before us which God wants us to claim.  We are faced with fears, feelings of inadequacy, people telling us we can't do it, we don't deserve it, we're too old…..God wants us to face these challenges and claim our mountain.  

> _Then the land had rest from war._ -Joshua 14:15

**Questions:**
1. What is the mountain God wants you to possess?   
2. What giants are standing in your way? 
3. Are you willing to face these giants in order to claim your inheritance?
