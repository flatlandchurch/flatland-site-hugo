#### [2 Timothy 4:1-4][2tim4]

When we read and study God’s Word, I have found two big mistakes. Both lead one down the path to destruction although they take very different ways. Simply put we need people who know the [Truth of God][1jhn4] who can help us not veer to the right or left of the [narrow path][narrow] that we have set out. [John is clear on this][1jhn4], we can test and recognize “the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood” in people that try to explain God’s Word.

The first mistake people make is to try to go it alone. Invariably when one tries study
God’s Word isolated from others, they will misinterpret it. Throughout the history of the Church, false teachings have arisen because someone didn’t understand some of the [harder passages][2pete] so they twist Scripture into their own fantasies. Commonly called heresies, these false teachings have in some cases lead to whole groups of Christians being lead down the wrong path, simply because one person felt they could do it alone. When we try to do it on our own, we will most likely will fall into a trap of falsehood simply because we don’t see it as such. We need people to help keep us in the truth.

The second mistake is to read and study God’s Word with those that are more concerned with making everyone happy. They lead people down the path that sounds good, Paul says it “tickles their ears.” This is the one that isn’t usually as easy to spot as heretical teachers. We hear what we want to hear and believe it. Usually this trap comes by not including parts of Scripture that challenges us and exaggerating teachings that make us happy happy joy joy. The truth is twisted to our own selfish ends and we are attracted to it. As we read the Bible, we need to be guided by the entire Word. Studying with others helps keep us balanced, so we don’t focus on just that thing that we we like and understand.

> _Teach me, Lord, the way of your decrees,    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may follow it to the end.    
Give me understanding, so that I may keep your law    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and obey it with all my heart.   
Direct me in the path of your commands,    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for there I find delight.    
Turn my heart toward your statutes    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not toward selfish gain.   
Turn my eyes away from worthless things;   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserve my life according to your word.   
Fulfill your promise to your servant,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that you may be feared.   
Take away the disgrace I dread,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your laws are good.   
How I long for your precepts!    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your righteousness preserve my life._ -Psalm 119:33-40
