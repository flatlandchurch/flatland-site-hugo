### [Hebrews 4:14-16][1]

Support groups exist so that people who have experienced similar situations can come together and offer encouragement to one another and work through the process of healing together. Members feel understood and validated by their peers who have gone through the same thing, and benefit from sharing their struggles, as well as successes. They experience empathy in its purest form… they have literally walked in each other’s shoes. There is no veil keeping one from entering a support group; members walk in and are able to lay their experiences and emotions on the table with confidence.  

God gave us divine support in Jesus. Before Jesus, man was separated from God by his sin. Just as God recognized that Adam needed a helpmate, he recognized that we needed him in human form. We needed to Jesus to walk among us, face pain and temptation, live and die as one of us, and live eternally in us. Now, thanks to his ultimate sacrifice, there is no veil keeping us from approaching God; only Jesus. We have the support of someone who has literally walked in our shoes. We can walk in and lay our experiences and emotions on God’s table with confidence.  

> _Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess._  [Hebrews 4:14][1]
