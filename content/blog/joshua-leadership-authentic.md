**[Joshua 1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua1-5)**

A leader without followers is just a guy out taking a walk.  We’re all leaders in one or more capacities such as parent, counselor to others on matters regarding our particular professional discipline, showing a tourist the correct way to a local venue, etc.  And, likewise, we’re followers in many varied situations. As followers of Jesus, we need to identify authentic leadership to give us the confidence required to follow leaders as they walk with Christ.

Joshua is such a leader.  He and Caleb were the only two of twelve men who gave an honest assessment of the fate of those who would oppose Israel’s occupation of the promised land. (see Numbers 13 and 14, especially [14:5-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers14:5-9)).  Joshua lived to see the promised land and, as Moses was not permitted due to his own disobedience, the torch was passed to Joshua in front of the whole assembly.  Furthermore, God Himself spoke to Joshua giving him orders from His own mouth for the people to follow, as we see in Joshua 1:1 and following.

One of the first things we predictably do when being promoted to our former boss’ position is make the job our own is ways ranging from the discrete to the overwhelming.  In this case, Joshua will have none of that.  That Moses was the prophet of the Lord is an uncontestable fact.  The “sign” ([Exodus 4:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus4:1-5)) Moses asked the Lord for to authenticate his authority before men was lavishly multiplied at least 20-fold.  Now as Joshua assumes leadership, his plan is to continue to follow the Lord exactly as Moses had, without wavering an inch either to the right or to the left (v7).  Joshua is laser-focused on making this ministry all about the Lord and not one bit about himself.  All these and other things we’re going to explore in this book testify to the authenticity of Joshua’s God-given leadership and furthermore, give us great insight into identifying authentic leadership to this day.

**Questions**
1. Jump ahead to [Joshua 24:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua24:15) for a moment.  Whom do you serve?
2. God appoints leaders whom He knows are faithful to Him and then puts them in our lives on purpose.  How can you serve the Lord by following these leaders so that they may, in fact, lead?
