The practice of communion holds significant meaning within Christianity. It is a means of spiritual nourishment, a reminder of Christ's sacrifice, a symbol of unity among believers, and a participation in the ongoing presence of Christ until He comes again. The bread signifies the body of Christ, while the cup signifies His blood that was shed on the cross when He died for the sins of the world.

### Who can take part in communion?

Communion identifies us with Christ. Therefore, those who partake of communion are those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God who died for the sins of the world and was raised to life again. We have pledged our allegiance to Him as Lord of our lives. If you are a follower of Jesus, regardless of your church affiliation, we invite you to take communion with us.

### When is communion available at Flatland?

We typically take communion as an entire congregation on the last Sunday of each sermon series. We also take communion corporately on Good Friday and other special occasions. Every other Sunday, communion is available at our prayer stations in the auditorium. During or after our time of worship, you are welcome to partake of communion on your own or with family and friends.
