Prayer is at the core of everything we are at Flatland. The Apostle Paul encouraged his friends to never stop praying. We offer opportunities to be prayed for and to join with others in corporate prayer. 

We would love to pray with you. We have a team of people who lift up people in prayer every single day. Fill out the form below to submit a prayer request.
