The church is full of untapped potential. God wants to empower His people with spiritual gifts that will build up the body of Christ in a supernatural way. The Bible says that we should eagerly desire these gifts, but oftentimes we are content to live without them or confused about how they work. In this series we will tap into what God has for us and experience the power of His Spirit like never before.
