### The Athanasian Creed

The Athanasian Creed is an ancient belief statement of the Church developed to help answer questions about the Trinity. It was designed to respond to claims that the Son was created by the Father or that God is revealed in "modes" based on His actions.

Since the Athanasian Creed was written and ratified by the unified Christian Church before any schisms or denominational breaks, the word _catholic_ is used throughout to refer to the global, unified Church. In this context it does not refer to the Roman Catholic church, but to the unified Church of Christ, both past and present.
