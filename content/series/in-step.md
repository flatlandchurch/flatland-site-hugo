In Step is a study through the book of Galatians. This bold and confrontational letter from the apostle Paul and his associates addresses the rift between Jewish Christians and the burgeoning group of Gentile Christians joining the church. In the midst of the challenging questions about fellowship, ethnicity and justification sits a beautiful presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This series will sharpen your understanding of what exactly Jesus came to do, and how we can remain in step with His Spirit.
