Sin is the number one thing keeping us from moving to the center of God's kingdom and experiencing the abundant life He has for us. In an authentic Christian culture we have the responsibility of dealing effectively with sin in each other's lives. We receive immediate sanctification (salvation) through the work of Christ. And we receive progressive sanctification (transformation) through the work of the Holy Spirit. We simply cannot ignore sin.
