During His miraculous ministry on earth, Jesus delivered a pivotal sermon to crowds of people. In it, He painted a defining description of who His followers were going to be. If we are to truly follow Jesus, this message from the side of a mountain must become the portrait to which we seek to conform. As we study through this series, focusing on Matthew 5-7, you will be called and compelled to hear the words of Jesus in a way that transforms your life.
