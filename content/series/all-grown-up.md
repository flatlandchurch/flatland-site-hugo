You don’t want to be a baby all your life. You probably don’t want the people around you to always act like babies either. That’s why you don’t want to miss our first series of the year: All Grown Up. Believe it or not, the church can actually be a place where people are mature and fun to be around. Learn to eliminate those embarrassing, adult, temper tantrums. Enjoy interactions with people who once annoyed you to death. Find out how it looks to be like Jesus as we study what the Bible has to say in Ephesians chapter 4.
