This series is all about our core values at Flatland: Authenticity, Love, Transformation, Collaboration, and Enthusiasm. The more we learn and discuss these core values, the more they will shape our culture and the experience people have at our church. The more we live out these values, the more we will find ourselves moving to the center of God's kingdom.
