## Week of Prayer

_January 7-13, 2024_

**Come pray with us.**

The church will be open for prayer Monday through Thursday, 7:00-8:00am and 7:00-8:00pm. Simply enter our auditorium and spend time seeking the Lord and praying for our daily focus. We'll have quiet music playing, and you are free to sit or walk about as you pray.

**Daily Prayer Focus**

> Monday: Pray for a hunger for God's word and greater biblical literacy within our church.

> Tuesday: Pray for the ongoing development of our Flatland Life Center.

> Wednesday: Pray for our children's and youth ministries.

> Thursday: Pray for a great Omaha School of Ministry semester starting next week.

> Friday: Pray for our missionaries and organizations we support through The Move.

> Saturday: Pray for friends and family who need to know and follow Jesus.
