## Week of Prayer

_January 7-13, 2024_

**Come pray with us.**

The church will be open for prayer Monday through Thursday, 7:00-8:00am and 7:00-8:00pm. Simply enter our auditorium and spend time seeking the Lord and praying for our daily focus. We'll have quiet music playing, and you are free to sit or walk about as you pray.

> “There’s no way I can use this.”

> “What am I going to do with this?”

> “There’s no way I would ever put this on!”

A friend of mine carved a wall hanging out of wood for me. When I caught wind that he was making it, I panicked. There was a wall I thought he was making it for, and I had other plans for that wall. When he finally presented the gift to me, I rejected it. He was devastated, and left with his gift in tow. I later told him I had other plans for that wall. When he told me that he was never concerned with where I put it, I was utterly embarrassed by my response. I vowed then and there to accept heart-felt gifts from friends, even if I didn’t believe I could use them.

It is amazing to think that anyone would refuse something God was offering, yet that is exactly what far too many people do. Every day, the gospel is preached and people reject His gift of salvation. People reject God’s gift of wisdom by refusing to study the Bible. People reject a life of virtue by quenching the gift of His transforming power.
