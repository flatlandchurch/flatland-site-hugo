Our Discipleship Pathway at Flatland is designed to help you move to the center of God's kingdom. Are you exploring Christianity? This is a great way for you to ask questions. Are you growing in your faith? We can help you know God better. Are you struggling to trust God? We would love to hear your story and strengthen your faith. Do you want to grow closer or stay centered? We have a pathway for you.

## Practicing Christianity

As your understanding of Christianity deepens, the real joy of following Jesus begins. In this section, you will learn how following Jesus and walking in step with His Spirit can lead you into an abundant life. This life is comprised of love, joy, peace, patience and so much more. You'll discover God's transforming presence and His healing power for our lives. And you'll begin to experience a more vibrant relationship with Him.
