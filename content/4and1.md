The event opens with a tailgate dinner. You can get a discount on the cost of your registration if you sign up to bring food for the tailgate party.

At this event, we’ll take a close look at scripture, learn from several business executives from Flatland, and spend time in God’s presence. The event will also be loaded with tailgate food, a great breakfast, laughter and entertainment.
