We all face tough decisions in life. What career field should I enter? Should I switch jobs? What should I do about this relationship I'm in? Am I going to watch the game today? If so, what should I eat? Okay, some decisions are less important than others. Discover how to go about making the toughest decisions in life at our annual Men's Event. Join us as we take a close look at scripture, learn from several business executives from Flatland, and spend time in Godâ€™s presence. The event will also be loaded with tailgate food, a great breakfast, laughter and entertainment.
